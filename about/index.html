<p>This is a prototype API search engine. I am playing around what is possible when it comes to API search, trying to push things forward when it comes to finding public APIs. I'm building this out in the open, and when up and running in will run 95% on GitHub, with just a small piece of it run on AWS, driving the orchestration of everything.</p>
