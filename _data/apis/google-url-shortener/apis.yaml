description: The Google URL Shortener at goo.gl is a service that takes long URLs
  and squeezes them into fewer characters to make a link that is easier to share,
  tweet, or email to friends. Users can create these short links through the web interface
  at goo.gl, or they can programatically create them through the URL Shortener API.
  With the URL Shortener API you can write applications that use simple HTTP methods
  to create, inspect, and manage goo.gl short links from desktop, mobile, or web.
