      description: 'This call lets you download a daily TSV_GZIP (tab separated value
        gzip) Item feed file. There are two Item feed files for every top-level (L1)
        category, including all its child categories: A file generated each day containing
        all the newly listed items for a specific category and date (feed_scope =
        NEWLY_LISTED) A file containing all the items in a specific category (feed_scope
        = ALL_ACTIVE) For each item, the primary item details are returned, except
        for the item description. The description of each item is excluded because
        these can be huge and items in an item group (an item with variations, such
        as size and color) can share the same description. The item descriptions are
        returned in a separate Item Description gzip feed file by the getItemDescriptionFeed
        call. To store all the item details provided by the Feed API, you would use
        the getItemFeed and getItemDescriptionFeed calls with the same parameters.
        For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /item?feed_scope=NEWLY_LISTED&amp;category_id=625&amp;date=20170918
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /item_description?feed_scope=NEWLY_LISTED&amp;category_id=625&amp;date=20170918
        Items returned in the feed file All items in the file are: In new condition
        Fixed price (Buy It Now); no auctions From eBay trusted sellers Note: When
        curating the items returned, be sure to code as if these filters are not applied
        as they can be changed or removed in the future. The feed file contains all
        the items from all the child categories of the specified category. The first
        line of the file is the header, which labels the columns and indicates the
        order of the values on each line. Each header is described in the Response
        fields section. URLs for this call Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/
        Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Downloading feed
        files Item feed files are binary gzip files. If the file is larger than 100
        MB, the download must be streamed in chunks. You specify the size of the chunks
        in bytes using the Range request header. The Content-range response header
        indicates where in the full resource this partial chunk of data belongs and
        the total number of bytes in the file. For more information about using these
        headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. Important: The response is always
        a TSV_GZIP file. But for documentation purposes, the response is shown as
        JSON fields so that the value returned in each column can be explained. The

        A file generated each day containing the item descriptions for all the newly

        A file containing the item descriptions for all the items in a specific category
        (feed_scope = ALL_ACTIVE) To store all the item details provided by the Feed

        Combining the Description and Item feed files The Description feed file contains
        only the itemId, itemGroupId and description columns. The value of the description
        column is BASE64 encoded for security reasons. For each row, there will be
        values in either itemId or itemGroupId. The description column will always
        contain a value. itemGroupId - The value in this column is the ID of an item
        group (an item with variations, such as size and color) where the items in
        the group share the same description. Even though the itemGroupId represents
        more than one item, the itemGroupId and description are returned only once
        for the entire group. In this case, there will be values in the itemGroupId
        and description columns. You match the value of itemGroupId from the Description
        feed file with the value of primaryItemGroupId from the Item feed file for
        the same day and category. itemId - The value in this column is the ID of
        an item that is not part of an item group or (in rare cases) the item is part
        of an item group but does not share a description with other items in the
        group. In this case, there will be values in the itemId and description columns.
        You match the value of itemId from the Description feed file with the value
        of itemId from the Item feed file for the same day and category. The file
        will contain the descriptions for all the items or item groups from all the
        child categories of the category. The first line of the file is the header,
        which labels the columns and indicates the order of the values on each line.
        Each column is described in the Response fields section. URLs for this call

        gzip) Item Group feed file. There are two Item Group feed files for every
        top-level (L1) category, including all its child categories: A file generated
        each day containing item group information for all the newly listed items
        for a specific category and date (feed_scope = NEWLY_LISTED) A file containing
        item group information for all the items in a specific category (feed_scope
        = ALL_ACTIVE) The service reads each of the Item feed files and if an item
        in the feed file has a primaryItemGroupId value, which indicates the item
        is part of an item group, the service uses that value to return the item group
        (parent item) information for that item in the corresponding NEWLY_LISTED
        or ALL_ACTIVE Item Group feed file. This information includes a list of the
        aspect (variation) names for this item group. For example, if the item was
        a shirt some of the variation names could be Size, Color, etc., which are
        returned in the variesByLocalizedAspects column. (An item group is an item
        that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity,
        etc.) The first line in any feed file is the header, which labels the columns
        and indicates the order of the values on each line. Each header is described
        in the Response fields section. Combining the Item Group and Item feed files
        The Item Group feed file contains details about the item group (parent item),
        including the item group ID itemGroupId. You match the value of itemGroupId
        from the Item Group feed file with the value of primaryItemGroupId from the
        Item feed file for the same day and category. Downloading feed files URLs

        URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Item Group feed files
        are binary gzip files. If the file is larger than 100 MB, the download must
        be streamed in chunks. You specify the size of the chunks in bytes using the
        Range request header. The content-range response header indicates where in
        the full resource this partial chunk of data belongs and the total number
        of bytes in the file. For more information about using these headers, see
        Retrieving a gzip feed file. Important: The response is always only a TSV_GZIP
        file. But for documentation purposes, the response is shown as JSON fields
        so that the value returned in each column can be explained. The order of the
        response fields, shows you the order of the columns in the feed file. Restrictions

        This means to generate the 8AM file of items that have changed from 8AM and

        snapshot feed files are binary gzip files. If the file is larger than 100
        MB, the download must be streamed in chunks. You specify the size of the chunks
        in bytes using the Range request header. The Content-range response header
        indicates where in the full resource this partial chunk of data belongs and
        the total number of bytes in the file. For more information about using these
        headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. Important: The response is always
        a TSV_GZIP file. But for documentation purposes, the response is shown as
        JSON fields so that the value returned in each column can be explained. The
        order of the response fields, shows you the order of the columns in the feed
