description: Amazon EMR provides a managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy, fast,
  and cost-effective to process vast amounts of data across dynamically scalable Amazon
  EC2 instances. You can also run other popular distributed frameworks such as Apache
  Spark, HBase, Presto, and Flink in Amazon EMR, and interact with data in other AWS
  data stores such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.Amazon EMR securely and reliably
  handles a broad set of big data use cases, including log analysis, web indexing,
  data transformations (ETL), machine learning, financial analysis, scientific simulation,
  and bioinformatics.
