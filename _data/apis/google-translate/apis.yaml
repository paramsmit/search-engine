description: Cloud Translation API provides a simple programmatic interface for translating
  an arbitrary string into any supported language. Translation API is highly responsive,
  so websites and applications can integrate with Translation API for fast, dynamic
  translation of source text from the source language to a target language (e.g.,
  French to English). Language detection is also available In cases where the source
  language is unknown. The underlying technology pushes the boundary of Machine Translation
  and is updated constantly to seamlessly improve translations and introduce new languages
  and language pairs.
