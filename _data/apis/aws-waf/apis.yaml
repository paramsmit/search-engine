description: AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your webapplications
  from common web exploits that could affect applicationavailability, compromise security,
  or consume excessive resources. AWSWAF gives you control over which traffic to allow
  or block to your webapplications by defining customizable web security rules. You
  can use AWSWAF to create custom rules that block common attack patterns, such as
  SQLinjection or cross-site scripting, and rules that are designed for your specific
  application. New rules can be deployed within minutes, letting you respondquickly
  to changing traffic patterns. Also, AWS WAF includes a full-featuredAPI that you
  can use to automate the creation, deployment, and maintenanceof web security rules.With
  AWS WAF you pay only for what you use. AWS WAF pricing is based on how many rules
  you deploy and how many web requests your web application receives. There are no
  upfront commitments.You can deploy AWS WAF on either Amazon CloudFront as part of
  your CDN solution or the Application Load Balancer (ALB) that fronts your web servers
  or origin servers running on EC2.
