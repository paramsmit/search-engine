  helps you fund and manage your international business by making trading and payments
  easy to integrate into **your** applications; you choose to how and where to deploy
  your application, and we provide the means to integrate foreign exchange functionality
  in them **directly**. The API is modular, with the following core areas of functionality:\n\n-
  Quotes: Get live rates, either estimated or a short-lived quote that you can use
  to book a trade;\n- Trades: Use a quote to execute a trade;\n- Payments: Use a trade
  to fund a payment or payments;\n- Multi Payments: Wraps trades, beneficiary managements
  and payments into a \"bulk\" operation, allowing many payments to be made across
  a number of currencies;\n- Account Management: Profile updates, beneficiary management,
  etc.\n\nIn terms of style, the API is a \"pragmatic\" REST + JSON API with a design
  approach aimed at simplicity and ease of use. A few notes:\n\n* URIs do not descend
  more that one i.e. /quotes, /trades, etc.;\n* We use links where it makes sense
  to convey information to our API consumers but we are not religious about full-on
  HATEOAS/code-on-demand style. If links help we use them;\n* We will version our
  API on major versions only, with the version number defined in the hostname , e.g.
  [https://api-v1.ebury.io/trades]();\n* We'll be looking to add support for Webhooks
