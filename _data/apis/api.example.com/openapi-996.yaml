  Who is this for?\n\nThis documentation is for developers creating their own integration
  with [Receptive's](https://www.receptive.io) API. If you are doing a standard integration,
  there's a really easy [Javascript integration](https://help.receptive.io/hc/en-us/articles/209221969-How-to-integrate-Receptive-with-your-app)
  that you should know about before you go to the effort of building your own integration.\n\n##
  Authentication\n\nAPI calls generally need to be authenticated. Generate an API
  Key at https://receptive.io/app/#/vendor/settings?section=integrate. This key should
  then be added to every request URL as a query parameter named 'auth-token'\n\n##
  Endpoint\n\nAPI endpoint is https://api.eu-west-1.receptive.io.\n## Notes\n\nAPI
  endpoints are being added to this documentation as needed by customers. If you don't
  see an endpoint you need please contact support and if it exists we'll publish the
  docs here. The 'try it out' feature on this documentation page will probably be
  blocked by your browser because the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header has its value
  set by the Receptive server depending on your hostname.\n\n## Generating client
  code\n\nThis documentation is automatically generated from an OpenAPI spec available
  [here](http://apidoc.receptive.io/receptive.swagger.json). You can use Swagger to
  auto-generate API client code in many languages using the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/)\";s:5:\"title\";s:9:\"Receptive\";s:7:\"version\";s:5:\"1.0.0\";s:21:\"x-apisguru-categories\";a:1:{i:0;s:9:\"ecommerce\";}s:6:\"x-logo\";O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{s:3:\"url\";s:84:\"https://api.apis.guru/v2/cache/logo/https_twitter.com_receptiveio_profile_image.jpeg\";}s:8:\"x-origin\";a:1:{i:0;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:6:\"format\";s:7:\"swagger\";s:3:\"url\";s:49:\"http://apidoc.receptive.io/receptive.swagger.json\";s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:11:\"x-preferred\";b:1;s:14:\"x-providerName\";s:12:\"receptive.io\";}"
