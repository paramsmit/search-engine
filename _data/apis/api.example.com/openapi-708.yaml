  API enables you to search contact information you like in a more automated way.
  The API is designed with the simplicity for automation in mind. If you need a more
  human-friendly interface, please consider [Leadbook platform](https://platform.leadbook.com)
  or directly [contact us](mailto:zheng@leadbook.com).\n\nIn order to use the API,
  you first need to determine whether you are looking for company or contact profiles.
  For contact profile queries, check the \"/contact\" endpoint. Similarly, check the
  \"/company\" endpoint for company profile queries.\n\nOn the other hand, the procedures
  of contact and company queries are very simiar. Consier the following steps to get
  the profiles you want.\n\n1. **Formulate and test your query filters**. Are you
  looking for contacts working in a certain company or with a certain job title? Or
  are you looking for companies in industries or with a certain employee size? Please
  refer to the \"filters\" body parameter in `/contact/search` or `/company/search`
  for the formats of the filters. Once you have determined the filters, you may use
  the search API to get the total number of profiles matched to the filters you specify.
  Getting the count is free, as long as the frequency of the call is not too high.\n2.
  **Unlock the matched profiles**. After having determined your filters and got the
  count of matched profiles, you can unlock them to get the full profiles by relegating
  the same set of filters to `/contact/unlock` or `/company/unlock`. Note that credits
  will be deducted for every profile you unlock. By default, calling the \"unlock\"
  API will cause all matched profiles to be unlocked, but you can specify two additional
  url parameters: \"limit\" and \"page\" to decide how many profiles you want to unlock
  in one batch and where the starting point of this batch is. Note that if a profile
  you try to unlock has already been unlocked for your API key before, you will not
  be double charged. Also note taht since unlocking is a time-consuming process, you
  are not immediately given the profiles. Instead, you are given a **task id** for
  the unlocking task.\n3. **Look up the unlocked profiles**. Armed with the task id
  given by the `unlock` API call, you can use `/lookup` to retrieve the profiles you
  queried. Again, profiles which have already been unlocked will be remembered and
  will not be double charged in a future unlock.\n\";s:14:\"termsOfService\";s:24:\"http://swagger.io/terms/\";s:7:\"contact\";O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{s:5:\"email\";s:16:\"cto@leadbook.com\";}s:7:\"license\";O:8:\"stdClass\":2:{s:4:\"name\";s:11:\"MIT
