  Data to The Blue Alliance. The API is accessed through POST requests made to the
  endpoints described below. To simplify the removal of incorrect data, most endpoints
  must be called with the full dataset. For example, there is no endpoint to add a
  single award-- only to update all awards. It must be called with all awards, and
  the ones that are no longer present will be deleted. **The exception to this is
  the matches endpoint**, where there are separate endpoints to update and delete
  matches. Also, the **match videos endpoint** only allows the addition (and not the
  removal) of videos.\n# Authentication\nThe X-TBA-Auth-Id and X-TBA-Auth-Sig must
  be included as request headers in all requests.\n\n*auth_id*: ``  *auth_secret*:
  ``\n\n*X-TBA-Auth-Id*: `auth_id`  *X-TBA-Auth-Sig*: `md5_hexdigest()`\n\nFor example,
  an X-TBA-Auth-Sig may look like `md5_hexdigest(ExqeZK3Gbo9v95YnqmsiADzESo9HNgyhIOYSMyRpqJqYv13EazNRaDIPPJuOXrQp/api/trusted/v1/event/2014casj/matches/delete[\"qm1\"])`\n\nWhich,
  after hashing, becomes: `ca5c3e5c1b0e7132e4af13f805eca0be`\";s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"3.1\";}"
