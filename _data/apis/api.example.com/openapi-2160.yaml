  Recurring Service\";s:11:\"description\";s:1194:\"The Recurring APIs allow you to
  manage and remove your tokens or saved payment details. Tokens should be created
  with validation during a payment request.\n\nFor more information, refer to our
  [Tokenization documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/features/tokenization).\n##
  Authentication\nTo connect to the Recurring API, you must use your basic authentication
  credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get
  the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password).
  Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U
  \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\"
  \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user
  credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n##
  Versioning\nRecurring API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version
  suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where
  XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Recurring/v25/disable\n```\";s:14:\"termsOfService\";s:48:\"https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\";s:7:\"contact\";O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:4:\"name\";s:13:\"Adyen
