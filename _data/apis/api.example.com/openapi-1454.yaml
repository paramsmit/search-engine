  Data Streaming API exposes a stream of events describing a user\u2019s experience
  within a mobile app or browser. Events reflect user action, automated device responses
  to their environment (e.g. encountering a beacon), and experience-changing actions
  initiated by app/site publishers, such as sending a push notification.\n\nTo consume
  the event stream, you must issue an authenticated request including a starting point
  for the stream and optional filter and subset specifications.\n\nThe event data
  is delivered as newline-delimited JSON, with each event on its own line. Each event
  contains an offset that denotes its location on the stream. If a client disconnects
  for any reason, it should reconnect with instructions to start at the last offset
  it successfully processed, to avoid missing any data. For each app key authorized
  to use Real-time Data Streaming, Airship stores 7 days or 100GB worth of data, whichever
  comes first.\n\";s:5:\"title\";s:36:\"Airship Real-time Data Streaming API\";s:7:\"version\";s:2:\"V3\";}"
