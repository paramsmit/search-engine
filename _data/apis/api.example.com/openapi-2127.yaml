  Secrets Manager API Reference</fullname> <p>AWS Secrets Manager is a web service
  that enables you to store, manage, and retrieve, secrets.</p> <p>This guide provides
  descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service,
  see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html\">AWS
  Secrets Manager User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>API Version</b> </p> <p>This version
  of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17.</p>
  <note> <p>As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS
  SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages
  and platforms (such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android). The SDKs provide a convenient
  way to create programmatic access to AWS Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs
  take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests
  automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download
  and install them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon
  Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make
  programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets
  Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service.
  To learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html\">Making
  Query Requests</a> in the <i>AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. </p> <p>Secrets
  Manager supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API doesn't
  require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests
  are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require
  larger sizes, use a POST request.</p> <p> <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets
  Manager</b> </p> <p>We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a href=\"mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com\">awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com</a>,
  or post your feedback and questions in the <a href=\"http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296\">AWS
  Secrets Manager Discussion Forum</a>. For more information about the AWS Discussion
  Forums, see <a href=\"http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa\">Forums Help</a>.</p>
  <p> <b>How examples are presented</b> </p> <p>The JSON that AWS Secrets Manager
  expects as your request parameters and that the service returns as a response to
  HTTP query requests are single, long strings without line breaks or white space
  formatting. The JSON shown in the examples is formatted with both line breaks and
  white space to improve readability. When example input parameters would also result
  in long strings that extend beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance
  readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string.</p>
  <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail,
  a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files
  to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by AWS CloudTrail,
  you can determine which requests were successfully made to Secrets Manager, who
  made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets Manager
  and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail\">Logging
  AWS Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail</a> in the <i>AWS Secrets Manager
  User Guide</i>. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and
  find your log files, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html\">AWS
  CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"license\";O:8:\"stdClass\":2:{s:4:\"name\";s:18:\"Apache
