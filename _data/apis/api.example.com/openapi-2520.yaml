  Security Token Service</fullname> <p>The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web
  service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for
  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate
  (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed
  information about using this service, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">Temporary
  Security Credentials</a>. </p> <note> <p> As an alternative to using the API, you
  can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various
  programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The
  SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to STS. For example,
  the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying
  requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download
  and install them, see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon
  Web Services page</a>. </p> </note> <p>For information about setting up signatures
  and authorization through the API, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html\">Signing
  AWS API Requests</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. For general information
  about the Query API, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html\">Making
  Query Requests</a> in <i>Using IAM</i>. For information about using security tokens
  with other AWS products, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html\">AWS
  Services That Work with IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>If you're
  new to AWS and need additional technical information about a specific AWS product,
  you can find the product's technical documentation at <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/\">http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/</a>.
  </p> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>The AWS Security Token Service (STS) has a default
  endpoint of https://sts.amazonaws.com that maps to the US East (N. Virginia) region.
  Additional regions are available and are activated by default. For more information,
  see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html\">Activating
  and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
  <p>For information about STS endpoints, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region\">Regions
  and Endpoints</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <b>Recording API
  requests</b> </p> <p>STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records
  AWS calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By
  using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were
  successfully made to STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To
  learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files,
  see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html\">AWS
  CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"license\";O:8:\"stdClass\":2:{s:4:\"name\";s:18:\"Apache
