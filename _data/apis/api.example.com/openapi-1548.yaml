  GlobalWineScore API is designed as a RESTful API, providing several resources and
  methods depending on your usage plan.\n\nFor further information please refer to
  <a href=\"https://www.globalwinescore.com/plans\" target=\"_blank\">our plans</a>.\n\n#
  Authentication\nThe API uses token-based authentication.\nIn order to authenticate
  your requests, you need to include a specific header in each of your requests:\n\n```\nAuthorization:
  Token {YOUR-API-TOKEN}\n```\n\nIf you don't have a token yet, you need to apply
  for one [here](https://www.globalwinescore.com/api/) or drop us an email at <a href=\"mailto:api@globalwinescore.com\">api@globalwinescore.com</a>\n\nYour
  personal token can be found under the <a href=\"https://www.globalwinescore.com/account/api/\"
  target=\"_blank\">My account > API</a> section of the GlobalWineScore website\n\n#
  Format\nThe API provides several rendering formats which you can control using the
  `Accept` header or `format` query parameter.\n\n- JSON (default): no header or `Accept:
  application/json`\n- XML: `Accept: application/xml`\n\n# Error handling\n\nWhether
  a request succeeded is indicated by the HTTP status code. A 2xx status code indicates
  success, whereas a 4xx status code indicates failure.\n\nWhen a request fails, the
  response body is still JSON, but always contains a `detail` field with a description
  of the error, which you can inspect for debugging.\n\nFor example, trying to access
  the API without proper authentication will return code 403 along with the message:\n\n`{\"detail\":
  \"Authentication credentials were not provided.\"}`\n\nFound a bug ? send us an
  email at <a href=\"mailto:api@globalwinescore.com\">api@globalwinescore.com</a>\n\n#
  Ordering\n\nAt the moment, GlobalWineScores may be sorted by `date` and `score`.
  Use \"-\"\nto sort in descending order.\n\n# Continuous synchronization\n\nIf you
  need to synchronize your database with our API, you can query our API using `?ordering=-date`
  to get the newest scores first, which means you won't have to crawl the whole catalog
  every time :-)\n\n# Quick search interface\nIf you need to search our catalog (e.g.
  to align it with yours), we're providing you with a handy interface accessible here:
  <a href=\"https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/</a>\n\nYou
  need to be logged in (email/password) to access this page, but other than that you
  can share it with anyone in your team and start searching right away !\n\n# Resources\n\nThe
  details about available endpoints can be found below.\nYou can click on each endpoint
  to find information about their parameters.\n\";s:5:\"title\";s:15:\"GlobalWineScore\";s:7:\"version\";s:40:\"8234aab51481d37a30757d925b7f4221a659427e\";s:21:\"x-apisguru-categories\";a:1:{i:0;s:9:\"open_data\";}s:6:\"x-logo\";O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{s:3:\"url\";s:88:\"https://api.apis.guru/v2/cache/logo/https_twitter.com_GlobalWineScore_profile_image.jpeg\";}s:8:\"x-origin\";a:1:{i:0;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:6:\"format\";s:7:\"swagger\";s:3:\"url\";s:63:\"https://globalwinescore.docs.apiary.io/api-description-document\";s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:11:\"x-preferred\";b:1;s:14:\"x-providerName\";s:19:\"globalwinescore.com\";}"
