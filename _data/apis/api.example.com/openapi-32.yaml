  to the Voodoo Manufacturing API docs!\n\nYour Voodoo Manufacturing API key must
  be included with each request to the API. The API will look for the key in the \"api_key\"
  header of the request. <a href=\"https://voodoomfg.com/3d-print-api#get-access\"
  target=\"_blank\">You can request a key here.</a>\n\nThis API provides a programmatic
  interface for submitting printing orders to Voodoo Manufacturing. The general process
  for creating an order is as follows:\n  - Get a list of the available materials
  with the /materials endpoint\n  - Upload models to the API with the /models endpoint\n
  \ - Get quotes for shipping methods with the /order/shipping endpoint\n  - Get a
  quote for an order with the /order/create endpoint\n  - Confirm the order with the
  /order/confirm endpoint\n\nUploaded models and orders can be retrieved either in
  bulk or by id at the /model and /order endpoints, respectively.\n\nIn some cases,
  you may wish to get a quote for a specific model without the context of an order.
  In this case, you may use the /model/quote (if you've already uploaded the model
  to the API) or the /model/quote_attrs (lets you quote based on calculated model
  attributes) endpoints.\n\";s:5:\"title\";s:29:\"Voodoo Manufacturing 3D Print\";s:7:\"version\";s:5:\"2.0.0\";s:21:\"x-apisguru-categories\";a:1:{i:0;s:5:\"tools\";}s:6:\"x-logo\";O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{s:3:\"url\";s:82:\"https://api.apis.guru/v2/cache/logo/https_twitter.com_voodoomfg_profile_image.jpeg\";}s:8:\"x-origin\";a:1:{i:0;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:6:\"format\";s:7:\"swagger\";s:3:\"url\";s:37:\"https://api.voodoomfg.com/voodoo.yaml\";s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:11:\"x-preferred\";b:1;s:14:\"x-providerName\";s:13:\"voodoomfg.com\";}"
