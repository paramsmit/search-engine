  APIs for performing operations on Group entity in your Azure API Management deployment.
  Groups are used to manage the visibility of products to developers. Each API Management
  service instance comes with the following immutable system groups whose membership
  is automatically managed by API Management.  - **Administrators** - Azure subscription
  administrators are members of this group. - **Developers** - Authenticated developer
  portal users fall into this group. - **Guests** - Unauthenticated developer portal
  users are placed into this group. In addition to these system groups, administrators
  can create custom groups or [leverage external groups in associated Azure Active
  Directory tenants](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-aad#how-to-add-an-external-azure-active-directory-group).
  Custom and external groups can be used alongside system groups in giving developers
  visibility and access to API products. For example, you could create one custom
  group for developers affiliated with a specific partner organization and allow them
  access to the APIs from a product containing relevant APIs only. A user can be a
  member of more than one group.\";s:5:\"title\";s:19:\"ApiManagementClient\";s:7:\"version\";s:18:\"2018-06-01-preview\";s:21:\"x-apisguru-categories\";a:1:{i:0;s:5:\"cloud\";}s:6:\"x-logo\";O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{s:3:\"url\";s:131:\"https://api.apis.guru/v2/cache/logo/https_assets.onestore.ms_cdnfiles_onestorerolling-1606-01000_shell_v3_images_logo_microsoft.png\";}s:8:\"x-origin\";a:1:{i:0;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:6:\"format\";s:7:\"swagger\";s:3:\"url\";s:179:\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/master/specification/apimanagement/resource-manager/Microsoft.ApiManagement/preview/2018-06-01-preview/apimgroups.json\";s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:11:\"x-preferred\";b:1;s:14:\"x-providerName\";s:9:\"azure.com\";s:13:\"x-serviceName\";s:24:\"apimanagement-apimgroups\";s:6:\"x-tags\";a:2:{i:0;s:5:\"Azure\";i:1;s:9:\"Microsoft\";}}"
