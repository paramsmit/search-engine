  Flowroute APIs are organized around REST. Our APIs have resource-oriented URLs,
  support HTTP Verbs, and respond with HTTP Status Codes. All API requests and responses,
  including errors, will be represented as JSON objects. You can use the Flowroute
  APIs to manage your Flowroute phone numbers including setting primary and failover
  routes for inbound calls, and sending text messages (SMS and MMS) using long-code
  or toll-free numbers in your account.\";s:7:\"version\";s:5:\"0.1.1\";}"
