  Anywhere LMS API\";s:11:\"description\";s:1713:\"# Introduction\nThe Knowledge Anywhere
  API is provided to you in order to assist you in provisioning users and reporting.\n##
  Authentication\nThe API expects a `Authorization` header containing a bearer token
  to be sent with each request to the API.  In order to properly authorize with the
  API you will need to sign into your LMS's admin panel and obtain your client and
  secret keys under the Site section. \n\n\n  ## Rate Limiting\n\n  By default, the
  throttle (Rate Limit) is set to 100 requests per minute.   If you find you need
  capacity beyond the specified rate limit you may contact support to apply for a
  higher limit.   If the limit is exceeded in the given 60 second window, the request
  will return `409 - APPLICATION RATE LIMIT EXCEEDED`. Further requests will be banned
  for one minute.\n  \n  \n  ### Rate Limit Additional Information\n  \n  Each request
  returns two headers so you may track your rate limit.\n  \n  - `X-RATE-LIMIT-LIMIT`
  contains an integer representing the amount of requests you have made during the
  current window.\n  - `X-RATE-LIMIT-REMAINING` contains an integer representing the
  amount of requests remaining until you hit the the limit.    A value of `-1` means
  you have exceeded the rate limit.\n\n\n## Paging\n\n Where applicable, record sets
  are limited to 1000 records by default.   You can use the `offset` parameter to
  page through the records.    Start with a `offset` of `0` (or no offset at all),
  and increase it by `1000` with each request.\n\n## Examples\n- Simple Node example
  calling the `/users` endpoint with a `GET` to grab all users.   Shows how to grab
  a token and call the API with paging.  Link: [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/TaylorAckley/8977bc38659d3d0010a0135351de5d83)\";}"
