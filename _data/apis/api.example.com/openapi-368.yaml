  enables you to create powerful real estate solutions for a variety of scenarios.
  Access all information, documents, BIM models and processes through the unified
  eTASK Universal BIM API.  This API  offers a simple, fast and secure Access, based
  on the Openapi specification.  \r\n\r\nWrite Apps, integrate you data into other
  systems and digitize you workflow with the help of our API.\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\n*__Note__:
  If you need help using eTASK's APIs, then the best place to start is the issue list
  in the our [Github repository for the API](https://github.com/e-task/EtaskAPI).
  eTASK's support team for our application isn't able to answer questions about the
  API. Better, you contact the DEV team via GitHub, if you have a technical question.*\r\n\r\n##
  HTTP verbs\r\nWhere possible, the API strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for
  each action.\r\n\r\n* __HEAD__ : Can be issued against any resource to get just
  the HTTP header info.\r\n* __GET__  : Used for retrieving resources.\r\n* __POST__
  : Used for creating resources.\r\n* __PATCH__: Used for updating resources with
  partial JSON data. For instance, an Issue resource has title and body attributes.
  A PATCH request may accept one or more of the attributes to update the resource.
  PATCH is a relatively new and uncommon HTTP verb, so resource endpoints also accept
  POST requests.\r\n* __PUT__   : Used for replacing resources or collections. For
  PUT requests with no body attribute, be sure to set the Content-Length header to
  zero.\r\n* __DELETE__: Used for deleting resources.\r\n\r\n## Encoding\r\nThe client
  must include in the header of every request this encoding: \r\n```\r\nAccept-Charset
  : utf-8\r\n```\r\nThe resonse will deliver every request in the encoding of UTF-8.
  \r\n\r\n## Encoding for URL parameters\r\nWhen using GET operation to fetch entries
  from a form via any REST client, URL parameters may be required. Examples of URL
  parameters are qualification (q), fields, limit and sort. While using any of these
  parameters with request URL, these must be encoded properly and then used in the
  request. Else results may not be as expected.\r\nTo encode URL parameters, use any
  third party tool or site such as https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_urlencode.asp,
  where non-encoded URL parameters can be converted into encoded URL parameter string.
  Use these encoded parameters to send a REST request.\r\nFor example, for sending
  qualification on a form like this:\r\n```\r\n 'Incident Number' = 'INC000000000701'\r\n```\r\nthe
  request should be encoded and sent like this:\r\n```\r\n%27Incident+Number%27+%3D+%22INC000000000701%22\r\n```\r\n##
  Timezones\r\nSome requests allow for specifying timestamps or generate timestamps
  with time zone information. We apply the following rules, in order of priority,
  to determine timezone information for API calls. \r\nExplicitly provide an ISO 8601
  timestamp with timezone information\r\nFor API calls that allow for a timestamp
  to be specified, we use that exact timestamp. These timestamps look something like
  this\r\n\r\n```\r\n2014-02-27T15:05:06+01:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe provisioning of a
  timestamp in every field of type date or datetime is reqired in the API.\r\n\r\n##
  Errors\r\nWhen an error occurs, our API will return an appropriate HTTP status code
  and an error message description. Our SDKs will wrap this in an exception that you
  can catch and choose how to handle.\r\n\r\n## HTTP Status Codes\r\nThe response
  from eTASK will have an HTTP status code that will help you determine the cause
  of the error. Our API tries to use the appropriate HTTP status code to indicate
  the type of problem encountered. Below is an overview of what those codes mean,
  along with some suggestions that might help you fix things.\r\n\r\n### 400 Bad Request\r\nThis
  is likely to be caused by a programming error on your part. Check the requirements
  of the endpoint you're calling in the HTTP API Reference.\r\n\r\n### 401 Unauthorized\r\nThis
  means that we were not able to authenticate you based on the information provided
  in the request. Make sure you're sending your access_token and your credentials
  based on the security specification of our API. The section 'Authentication and
  API Keys' gives a detailed explanation of how this works.\r\n\r\nIf you're connecting
  using OAuth, don't forget that tokens can expire. These will need to be refreshed.
  Not doing so can also result in getting a 401 error.\r\n\r\nIf you need to check
  your application's system parameters page. This will include the token for your
  application.\r\n\r\n### 403 Forbidden\r\nYou don't have access to whatever it is
  you're asking for.\r\n\r\n### 404 Not Found\r\nYou're asking for something that
  doesn't exist. Check the URL that you're requesting.\r\n\r\n### 406 Not Accessible\r\nThis
  means it wasn't possible to respond with the format you requested. Check the Accept
  header that you're sending.\r\n\r\n### 422 Unprocessable Entity\r\nThe request was
  valid, but one or more of the parameters looks a little screwy. It's possible that
  you sent data in the wrong format. One example would be providing an array when
  we expected a string.\r\n\r\n### 429 Too Many Requests\r\nTo keep the amount of
  spam on eTASK as low as possible, our API limits the rate at which you can perform
  certain actions. Read the Rate Limits page to find out more.\r\n\r\n### 500 Internal
  Server Error\r\nUh-oh. Something went wrong on our side. We're sorry. We keep track
  of these, and we'll try to fix it! If possible, read the server log to get more
  information about this error.\r\n\r\n### 503 Service Unavailable\r\nThis means that
  we're having some trouble, and our servers are too busy to handle your request.
  You'll want to check for these and give your user a chance to retry the request.
  We keep track of these and try to make sure they don't happen.\r\n\r\n### 504 Gateway
  Timeout\r\nThis means the request is taking too long. However, it doesn't always
  mean that we didn't receive your request. We could still be chugging away on the
  changes you made, and this means that you may want to check before retrying.\r\n\r\n##
  Cross origin resource sharing\r\nThe API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing
  (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. You can read the CORS W3C Recommendation,
  or this intro from the HTML 5 Security Guide.\r\nHere's a sample request sent from
  a browser hitting http://example.com:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -i 'https://api.etask.io'
  -H Origin: 'http://example.com'\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin:
  *\r\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-Etask-OTP, X-RateLimit-Limit,
  X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes,
  X-Poll-Interval\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what the CORS preflight request looks like:\r\n```\r\ncurl
  -i 'https://api.etask.io' -H Origin: 'http://example.com' -X OPTIONS\r\nHTTP/1.1
  204 No Content\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers:
  Authorization, Content-Type, If-Match, If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Unmodified-Since,
  X-Etask-OTP, X-Requested-With\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PATCH,
  PUT, DELETE\r\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-Etask-OTP, X-RateLimit-Limit,
  X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes,
  X-Poll-Interval\r\nAccess-Control-Max-Age: 86400\r\n```\r\n\r\n## User agent required\r\nAll
  API requests MUST include a valid User-Agent header. Requests with no User-Agent
  header will be rejected. We request that you use your eTASK username, or the name
  of your application, for the User-Agent header value. This allows us to contact
  you if there are problems.\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUser-Agent: My-Awesome-Etask-App.etask.com\r\n```\r\n\r\ncURL
  sends a valid User-Agent header by default. If you provide an invalid User-Agent
  header via cURL (or via an alternative client), you will receive a 403 Forbidden
  response:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -iH User-Agent: 'https://api.etask.io/meta'\r\nHTTP/1.0
  403 Forbidden\r\nConnection: close\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nRequest forbidden
  by administrative rules.\r\nPlease make sure your request has a User-Agent header.\r\nCheck
  https://developer.etask.io for other possible causes.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conditional
  requests\r\nMost responses return an ETag header. Many responses also return a Last-Modified
  header. You can use the values of these headers to make subsequent requests to those
  resources using the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers, respectively. If
  the resource has not changed, the server will return a 304 Not Modified.\r\nNote:
  Making a conditional request and receiving a 304 response does not count against
  your Rate Limit, so we encourage you to use it whenever possible.\r\n```\r\ncurl
  -i 'https://api.etask.io/user'\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nCache-Control:

  Public Beta Key\r\nEvery customer of eTASK hat access to the API of the own instance.
  \r\nIn the cloud environment the api is available from the public internet. We have
  instituted a simple, single public beta key system to let anyone try it out. The
  API key is required for all endpoints.\r\nThe public beta key is 'yyz'\r\nPlease
  use this key while you develop your application and experiment with your integrations.
  Note: the public key is subject to rate limit constraints and we do not encourage
  live production deployments to use the public key.\r\n\r\n### Request a Production
  Key\r\nOnce you\u2019re ready to use the eTASK API in production, please visit our
  [customer portal](https://kundencenter.etask.de) to request a production API key
  for your instance. In your submission, please be prepared to provide the following:\r\n*\tYour
  instance uri\r\n*\tThe 'live date' of your app and feature that integrates with
  the API. Briefly describe how the eTASK API integrates with your app and provide
  screenshots of the implementation.\r\n*\tAs per our section 5 A of our terms of
  service, we require all apps that use the eTASK API to conspicuously display 'Powered
  By eTASK' attribution marks where the API is utilized. You can find approved official
  logo marks here. Please provide screenshots of your attribution placement.\r\n\r\nIf
  you have any question, please feel free to contact us at api@etask.io.  Please submit
  API corrections via github issues. Please see our terms of service for any restrictions
  on using the service. We also recommend using the Postman or another client tool
  for restfull API\u2019s view the API responses.\r\n\r\n## Request Content-Type\r\nThe
  Content-Type for POST and PUT requests must be set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  or multipart/form-data otherwise you may receive a bad request response.\r\n\r\n##
  Endpoint Names\r\nMost API endpoints provide the same content as their HTML counterparts
  in the related eTASK FM Portal. For example, the URL /room serves a list of rooms,
  the /api/room API provides the same information in JSON format. Please be aware,
  that the configuration of user rights and other UI related configuration of the
  FM-Portal can show less information, that the API.\r\n\r\n## Openapi file\r\nThe
  API is documented, based on the [specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)
  of the [Openapi Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/) fka as Swagger.\r\n\r\nWe
  provide direct access to out [Openapi 3.0 file](/docs/openapi.json). Use it in you
  favourite API tool. We are exited about what you will build upon our API. Have you
  made anything exciting? __Please share [here](https://twitter.com/etask)__.\";s:14:\"termsOfService\";s:14:\"TermsOfService\";s:7:\"contact\";O:8:\"stdClass\":2:{s:4:\"name\";s:30:\"eTASK
