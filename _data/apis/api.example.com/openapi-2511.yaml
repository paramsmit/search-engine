  Mar 29th 2019\";s:11:\"description\";s:3489:\"# Summary\nThe **NextGenPSD2** *Framework
  Version 1.3.2* offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of \nApplication
  Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data
  securely. \nThe NextGenPSD2 Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses
  the problem of multiple competing standards \nin Europe and, aligned with the goals
  of the Euro Retail Payments Board,\nenables European banking customers to benefit
  from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service') \nby granting TPPs
  safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and
  financial data.\n\nThe possible Approaches are:\n  * Redirect SCA Approach\n  *
  OAuth SCA Approach\n  * Decoupled SCA Approach\n  * Embedded SCA Approach without
  SCA method\n  * Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available\n  * Embedded
  SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method\n\n  Not every message defined in this
  API definition is necessary for all approaches. \n  Furthermore this API definition
  does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional\n
  \ Therefore for a particular implementation of a Berlin Group PSD2 compliant API
  it is only necessary to support \n  a certain subset of the methods defined in this
  API definition.\n\n  **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you
  are not sure \n  which message has to be used for the approach you are going to
  use.**\n\n## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification:\n*
  **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group
  PSD2 API.** \n  It is not an replacement in any sense.\n  The main specification
  is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2
  API.\n* **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to
  the ASPSP.**\n* **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches
  defined in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n* According to the OpenAPI-Specification
  [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]\n  \n
  \   \"If in is \"header\" and the name field is \"Accept\", \"Content-Type\" or
  \"Authorization\", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.\"\n  \n  The element
  \"Accept\" will not be defined in this file at any place.\n  \n  The elements \"Content-Type\"
  and \"Authorization\" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags \"content\" and
  \"security\".\n  \n* There are several predefined types which might occur in payment
  initiation messages, \n  but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation
  Guidelines.\n  Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this
  file either.\n  We added them for the convenience of the user.\n  If there is a
  payment product, which need these field, one can easily use the predefined types.\n
  \ But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.\n  \n* **We omit the definition
  of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional) \n  except
  they are mention in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n  Therefore the implementer
  might add the in his own realisation of a PSD2 comlient API in addition to the elements
  define in this file.\n   \n## General Remarks on Data Types\n\nThe Berlin Group
  definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the PSD2 API have to support at least
  the following characters\n\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\nA
  B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n/ -
