  Checkout Service\";s:11:\"description\";s:1263:\"Adyen Checkout API provides a simple
  and flexible way to initiate and authorise online payments. You can use the same
  integration for payments made with cards (including One-Click and 3D Secure), mobile
  wallets, and local payment methods (e.g. iDEAL and Sofort).\n\nThis API reference
  provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn
  more about the API, visit [Checkout documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout).\n\n##
  Authentication\nEach request to the Checkout API must be signed with an API key.
  For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get
  the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key). Then
  set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type:
  application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote
  that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n##
  Versioning\nCheckout API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version
  suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where
  XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://checkout-test.adyen.com/v41/payments\n```\";s:14:\"termsOfService\";s:48:\"https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\";s:7:\"contact\";O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:4:\"name\";s:13:\"Adyen
