  Administration functions which includes but not limited to Create, Update and Retrieve
  Customers, Create and Maintain Policies, Manage Benefits, Retrieve Transactions
  & Diary Events, Handling Payments, Handling Periodic Debits and Claims Management.

  JSON payloads to perform all these mentioned operations.  You can use your favorite
  HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use OneOffice APIs.\n\n# Authentication\nOneOffice
  APIs  offers following authentication mechanism \n  - **OAuth 2.0** - OneOffice
  APIs would follow the OAuth2.0 with the client credentials flow. A client_id and
  client_secret will be issued to the consumer of APIs in order to obtain access token.
  This token will then be included in request header as a bearer token for subsequest
  API requests. The generated tokens will have an expiry period (in minutes) after
  which a fresh token will be needed by caller of API.   \n\n\n# Getting Started\nOnce
  a valid account is registered by OneOffice support staff the corresponding details
  will be shared to consumers. This will contain a client_id and client_secret to
  obtain an access toekn. Consumer application will have to access the **/Auth/Token**
  endpoint for posting the provided credentials. \nAfter validating the accuracy of
  the provided client_id/client_secret, API will generate an access token (Bearer
  token) which will be passed in subsequent API's request headers.     \nPlease refer
  to **/Auth/Token** request/response model examples for more details on how to obtain
  an access token. \n```Note\n  OneOffice APIs use HTTPS protocol to secure the communication
  between client and API services.\n```\";s:7:\"contact\";O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{s:3:\"url\";s:44:\"https://www.ebix.com.au/contact/contact-form\";}s:7:\"license\";O:8:\"stdClass\":2:{s:4:\"name\";s:18:\"Ebix
