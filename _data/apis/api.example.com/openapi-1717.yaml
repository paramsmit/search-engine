  Payment Service\";s:11:\"description\";s:1246:\"A set of API endpoints that allow
  you to initiate, settle, and modify payments on the Adyen payments platform. You
  can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank
  transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.\n\nTo learn more about the
  API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).\n\n##
  Authentication\nTo connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication
  credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get
  the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password).
  Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U
  \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\"
  \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user
  credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n##
  Versioning\nPayments API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version
  suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where
  XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v46/authorise\n```\";s:14:\"termsOfService\";s:48:\"https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\";s:7:\"contact\";O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:4:\"name\";s:13:\"Adyen
