  William Hill Sessions API uses a central authentication service (CAS*) on all resources
  that require access to a customer\u2019s account or betting functionality. To authenticate,
  you\u2019ll need to supply a sportsbook username and password, in return you will
  be given an authentication ticket, which you can use on the majority of requests
  found within our services. <br /><br /><br /> The Sessions API should be used whenever
  you want to login a customer and:<br /><br /> <ul> <li>continue to use the William
  Hill API for that customer\u2019s transactions</li> <li>use other CAS-enabled William
  Hill services outside the suite of APIs</li> </ul> <br /> CAS is an enterprise Single
  Sign-On solution for web services (see https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CAS/Home).
  It is used by many William Hill services. <br /> Note: all requests must be executed
  over HTTPS and include an API key and secret.<br /><br /><br /> <b>Authentication
  Ticket Expiration Times</b><br /><br /> When a customer is logged in using the Sessions
  API, they are given an Authentication Ticket; using this ticket on subsequent API
  requests gives you access to account activities (such as placing a bet, deposits,
  etc). However, this ticket is only valid for a given period of time depending on
  how it is used. If the ticket is used and then has a period of inactivity longer
  than 7,200 seconds (2 hours), then the ticket will expire and further requests using
  the ticket will be denied - in effect, a customer has been logged out and will need
  to authenticate again. <br /><br /><br /> Normally, any ticket issued only has a
  maximum life expectancy of 28,000 seconds (8 hours) after which it can no longer
  be used, even if it has been used regularly. The customer again will be effectively
  logged out and will need to authenticate again. If you wish to avoid this, you need
  to set the query parameter extended to Y, which will enable your application to
  generate a ticket valid for 60 days without expiring due to inactivity. <br />\";s:5:\"title\";s:8:\"Sessions\";s:7:\"version\";s:5:\"2.0.0\";s:21:\"x-apisguru-categories\";a:1:{i:0;s:13:\"entertainment\";}s:6:\"x-logo\";O:8:\"stdClass\":1:{s:3:\"url\";s:85:\"https://api.apis.guru/v2/cache/logo/https_twitter.com_WillHillHelp_profile_image.jpeg\";}s:8:\"x-origin\";a:1:{i:0;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:6:\"format\";s:7:\"swagger\";s:3:\"url\";s:73:\"https://developer.williamhill.com/wh-docs/docs-sdks/sessions/swagger/docs\";s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:11:\"x-preferred\";b:1;s:14:\"x-providerName\";s:9:\"whapi.com\";s:13:\"x-serviceName\";s:8:\"sessions\";}"
