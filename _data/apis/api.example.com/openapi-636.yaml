openapi: 3.0.0

  JSON REST API allows you to submit and receive [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com/)
  messages. You can also get access to past messages and see your account profile.\n\nThe
  base URL to use for this service is `https://api.bulksms.com/v1`.  The base URL
  cannot be used on its own; you must append a path that identifies an operation and
  you may have to specify some path parameters as well.\n\n[Click here](/) to go to
  the main BulkSMS developer site.\n\nIn order to give you an idea on how the API
  can be used, some JSON snippets are provided below.  Have a look at the [messages
  section](#tag/Message) for more information.\n\nProbably the most simple example\n\n```\n{\n
  \   \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\n\nYou can
  send unicode automatically using the `auto-unicode` query parameter. \nAlternatively,
  you can specify UNICODE in the request body. Here is an example that sets the `encoding`
  explicitly\n\n```\n{\n  \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n  \"body\": \"Dobr\xE1 pr\xE1ce!
  Jak se m\xE1\u0161?\",\n  \"encoding\": \"UNICODE\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can also specify
  a from number\n\n```\n{\n    \"from\": \"+27007654321\",\n    \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n
  \   \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\nSimilar to above, but repliable\n\n```\n{\n
  \   \"from\": { \"type\": \"REPLIABLE\" },\n    \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n    \"body\":
  \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\nA message to a group called Everyone\n\n```\n{\n    \"to\":
  { \"type\": \"GROUP\", \"name\": \"Everyone\" },\n    \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n}\n```\n\nA
  message to multiple recipients\n\n```\n{\n    \"to\": [\"+27001234567\", \"+27002345678\",
  \"+27003456789\"],\n    \"body\": \"Happy Holidays!\"\n}\n```\n\nSending more than
  one message in the same request\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"to\": \"+27001234567\",\n
  \       \"body\": \"Hello World!\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"to\": \"+27002345678\",\n
  \       \"body\": \"Hello Universe!\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n**The insecure base URL
  `http://api.bulksms.com/v1` is deprecated** and may in future result in a `301`
  redirect response, or insecure requests may be rejected outright. Please use the
  secure (`https`) URI above.\n\n### HTTP Content Type\n\nAll API methods expect requests
  to supply a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`. All responses
  will have the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.\n\n### JSON Formatting\n\nYou
  are advised to format your JSON resources according to strict JSON format rules.
  While the API does attempt to parse strictly invalid JSON documents, doing so may
  lead to incorrect interpretation and unexpected results.\n\nGood JSON libraries
  will produce valid JSON suitable for submission, but if you are manually generating
  the JSON text, be careful to follow the JSON format. This include correct escaping
  of control characters and double quoting of property names.\n\nSee the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627)
  for further information.\n\n### Date Formatting\n\nDates are formatted according
  to ISO-8601, such as `1970-01-01T10:00:00+01:00` for 1st January 1970, 10AM UTC+1.\n\nSee
  the [Wikipedia ISO 8601 reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for further
  information.\n\nSpecifically, calendar dates are formatted with the 'extended' format
  `YYYY-MM-DD`. Basic format, week dates and ordinal dates are not supported. Times
  are also formatted in the 'extended' format `hh:mm:ss`. Hours, minutes and seconds
  are mandatory. Offset from UTC must be provided; this is to ensure that there is
  no misunderstanding regarding times provided to the API.\n\nThe format we look for
  is `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss[Z|[+-]hh:mm]`\n\nExamples of valid date/times are`2011-12-31T12:00:00Z`
  `2011-12-31T12:00:00+02:00`\n\n### Entity Format Modifications\n\nIt is expected
  that over time some changes will be made to the request and response formats of
  various methods available in the API.\nWhere possible, these will be implemented
  in a backwards compatible way.\nTo make this possible you are required to ignore
  unknown properties.\nThis enables the addition of information in response documents
  while maintaining compatibility with older clients.\n\n### Optional Request Entity
  Properties\n\nThere are many instances where requests can be made without having
  to specify every single property allowable in the request format.\nAny such optional
  properties are noted as such in the documentation and their default value is noted.\n\";s:5:\"title\";s:12:\"BulkSMS
