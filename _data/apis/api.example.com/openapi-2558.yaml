  to the documentation for [MasterMovies API](https://api.mastermovies.uk), compliant
  with [OpenAPI v3](https://swagger.io/specification/). This document describes how
  clients should interact with the API, such as the request types and expected responses.\n\nThis
  API is open to the public, free of charge. We do not take any responsibility and
  we are not liable for any damage caused through our services.\n\nFor the protection
  of our users and content, we reserve the right to refuse access to any user, namely
  through the use of Rate Limiting, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and CSRF
  (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.\n\n## MasterMoviesID Authorization\nCertain
  resources are protected and require valid authorization. This comes in the form
  of a cryptographically-signed [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) that must originate
  from a recognized Authority, such as the Authorization Endpoint on this API. The
  MasterMoviesID token contains all information about a user's session.\n\nJust like
  any other session token, it should not be disclosed to third-parties, which would
  give them immediate and unconditional access to all of your privileges. The nature
  of JWT means that tokens can not be rejected. The token is stored as secure HTTP-only
  cookie, making it impossible to be accessed by anything other than the browser.\n\nResource
  authorizations are generally available for 24 hours.\n\n## CSRF and state-changing
  requests\nTo protect against CSRF attacks, any state changing request must reflect
  the `CSRF-Token` cookie value as a `CSRF-Token` header. The token is provided automatically
  by the API as soon as any request is made. You may  need to \"ping\" the API to
  retrieve the tokens before being able to access state-changing endpoints. An non-matching
  token-pair will be immediately rejected with a `403 Fobidden` HTTP response and
  a JSON \"Bad CSRF token\" payload.\n\nIt is safe to copy and use the `CSRF-Token`,
  but take care not to disclose it to any malicous people. The `CSRF-Secret`, which
  is cryptographically related to the token, is encrypted and can only be read and
  decrypted by the server.\n\n## Rate-Limiting\nRate-limiting is carried out on a
  global basis for the entire API, as well as a per-endpoint basis. Global rate-limiting
  is restricted to 240 interactions a minute, regardless of the request or response.
  Each endpoint is free to further restrict usage based on the nature of the action.
  The most \"nested\" ratelimiting function can be examined with the `X-Ratelimit-Limit`,
  `X-Ratelimit-Remaining` and `X-Ratelimit-Reset` headers.\n\";s:7:\"version\";s:2:\"v2\";}"
