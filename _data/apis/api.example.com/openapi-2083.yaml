  Whiteflag Application Programming Interface (API) is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
  software implementation of the API layer that provides an interface with the Whiteflag
  messaging network on one or more underlying blockchains. It acts as a message transceiver
  between one or more blockchains and one or more end-user applications.\n\nThis API
  is a so called Minumum Viable Product (MVP), which means that it only supports the
  core features of the Whiteflag protocol for development and testing purposes. As
  such, it serves as the reference implementation of the Whiteflag protocol, but it
  is not designed and tested for secure usage and performance in a production environment.\n\nTwo
  methods are available for interaction with the API: 1. a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
  for originators to provide Whiteflag message to be sent on the blockchain, and 2.
  a [web socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) available on `/socket` based
  on [socket.io](https://socket.io/) for clients to listen for incoming Whiteflag
  messages from a blockchain. A webpage with embedded socket listener is available
  on [/listen](/listen).\n\nThis definition documents the API in [OpenAPI format](https://swagger.io/specification/).
  The following JSON schemas and specifications are used by this API definition and
  available with the links below:\n* [Whiteflag Protocol specification](protocol/whiteflag.standard.html)\n*
  [Whiteflag Protocol message schema](protocol/message.schema.json)\n* [Whiteflag
  API message metaheader schema](protocol/metaheader.schema.json)\n* [Whiteflag API
  state schema](protocol/state.schema.json)\n\nAll response bodies are structured
  as `{meta, data, errors}`, based on the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/),
  which has been used as a guideline (and as a guideline only).\";s:6:\"x-logo\";O:8:\"stdClass\":2:{s:3:\"url\";s:10:\"wflogo.png\";s:7:\"altText\";s:9:\"Whiteflag\";}}"
