      description: |-
        Returns all assets in the specified collection whose latest location exist within the specified bounding box.
        The bounding box is defined by two coordinates in the EPSG:4326 (WGS84) (for further details see
        http://epsg.io/4326):
        * left (longitude), bottom (latitude)
        * right (longitude), top (latitude)
        The results can be filtered by including key and value pairs to match in location meta data.

    put:
      summary: Add an asset location into a collection.
      description: |-
        Insert a location entry into the named collection for the given asset identifier and timestamp. In addition to
        adding the new asset location, the request also controls the retention of the location history that is
        stored for the given asset in the given collection.

          - If the mandatory property retain_history is set to false then all existing location history for the
          given asset is removed before the new location is added.

          - If the retain_history property is set to true and the optional property purge_history_before is not set
          then the new location is added to the existing set of locations for the given asset.

          - If retain_history is set to true and the optional property purge_history_before is set then any existing
          locations for the given asset that have a timestamp that is older than the supplied purge_history_before
          timestamp are first deleted. Next the new location is added to the set of locations that remain.

          - If the set of location entries for the given asset (after any possible removals) contains a location entry
           with the same timestamp as the new location then the location of that entry is updated rather than a new
           location entry being added.

          - Note the new entry is always added or used to update an existing entry.
