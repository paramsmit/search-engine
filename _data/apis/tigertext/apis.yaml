description: TigerText is a multi-platform, secure, real-time messaging application
  for the enterprise that allows text messages to be deleted from both the senders
  and the receivers phones after expiration, which could be a set period of time or
  after reading. The messages cannot be saved, copied or forwarded by recipients.
  TigerText does this by storing the message on a company server, not the receiving
  and sending device, and deleting when the expiration conditions are met.
