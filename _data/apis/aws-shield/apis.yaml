  that safeguards web applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection
  and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency,

  are two tiers of AWS Shield, Standard and Advanced. All AWS customers benefit from
  the automatic protections of AWS Shield Standard, at no additional charge. AWS Shield
  Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport
