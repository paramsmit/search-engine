description: AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code,
  runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild,
  you don&rsquo;t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild
  scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are
  not left waiting in a queue. You can get started quickly by using prepackaged build
  environments, or you can create custom build environments that use your own build
  tools. With CodeBuild, you are charged by the minute for the compute resources you
  use.
