description: AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Enterprise Edition),
  also known as AWS Microsoft AD, enables your directory-aware workloads and AWS resources
  to use managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. The Microsoft AD service is built
  on actual Microsoft Active Directory and does not require you to synchronize or
  replicate data from your existing Active Directory to the cloud. You can use standard
  Active Directory administration tools and take advantage of built-in Active Directory
  features such as Group Policy, trusts, and single sign-on. With Microsoft AD, you
  can easily joinAmazon EC2andAmazon RDS for SQL Serverinstances to a domain, and
  useAWS Enterprise IT applicationssuch asAmazon WorkSpaceswith Active Directory users
  and groups.
