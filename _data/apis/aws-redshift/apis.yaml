description: Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scaledata warehousethat
  makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using your existing
  business intelligence tools. Start small for $0.25 per hour with no commitments
  and scale to petabytes for $1,000 per terabyte per year, less than a tenth the cost
  of traditional solutions. Customers typically see 3x compression, reducing their
  costs to $333 per uncompressed terabyte per year.
