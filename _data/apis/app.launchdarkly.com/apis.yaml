description: Our vision is to eliminate risk for developers and operations teams from
  the software development cycle. As companies transition to a world built on software,
  there is an increasing requirement to move quickly&mdash;but that often comes with
  the desire to maintain control. LaunchDarkly is the feature management platform
  that enables dev and ops teams to control the whole feature lifecycle, from concept
  to launch to value.
