  name: Apache Avro
  summary: Apache Avro is a data serialization system. Avro relies on schemas. When
    Avro data is read, the schema used when writing it is always present. This permits
    each datum to be written with no per-value overheads, making serialization both
    fast and small. This also facilitates use with dynamic, scripting languages, since
    data, together with its schema, is fully self-describing.
