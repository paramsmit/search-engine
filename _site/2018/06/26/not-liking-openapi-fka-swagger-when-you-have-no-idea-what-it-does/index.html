    	        <h2>Not Liking OpenAPI (fka Swagger) When You Have No Idea What It Does</h2>
<p><span class="post-date">26 Jun 2018</span></p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/64_181_800_500_0_max_0_1_-1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>People love to hate in the API space. Ok, I guess its not exclusive to the API space, but it is a significant aspect of the community. I receive a regular amount of people hating on my work, for no reason at all. I also see people doing it to others in the API space on a regular basis. It always makes me sad to see, and have always worked to try to be as nice as I can to counteract the male negativity and competitive tone that often exists. While I feel bad for the people on the receiving end of all of this, I often times feel bad for the people on the giving end of things, as they are often not the most informed and up to speed folks, who seem to enjoy opening their mouth before they understand what is happening.</p>

<p>One thing I notice regularly, is that these same people like to bash on is OpenAPI (fka Swagger). I regularly see people (still) say how bad of an idea it is, and how it has done nothing for the API space. One common thread I see with these folks, which prevents me from saying anything to them, is that it is clear they really don’t have an informed view of what OpenAPI is. Most people spend a few minutes looking it, maybe read a few blog posts, and then establish their opinions about what it is, or what it isn’t. I regularly find people who are using it as part of their work, and don’t actually understand the scope of the specification and tooling, so when someone is being vocal about it and doesn’t use actually it, it is usually pretty clear pretty quickly how uninformed they are about the specification, tooling, and scope of the community.</p>

<p>I’ve been tracking on it since 2011, and I still have trouble finding OpenAPI specifications, and grasping all of the ways it is being used. When you are a sideline pundit, you are most likely seeing about 1-2% of what OpenAPI does–I am a full time pundit in the game and I see about 60%. The first sign that someone isn’t up to speed is they still call it Swagger. The second sign is they often refer to it as documentation. Thirdly, they often refer to code generation with Swagger as a failure. All three of these views date someone’s understanding to about a 2013 level. If someone is forming assumptions, opinions, and making business decisions about OpenAPI, and being public about it, I’d hate to see what the rest of their technology views look like. In the end, I just don’t even feel like picking on them, challenging them on their assumptions, because their regular world is probably already kicking their ass on a regular basis–no assistance is needed.</p>

<p>I do not feel OpenAPI is the magical solution to fix all the challenges the API space, but it does help reduce friction at almost every stop along the API lifecycle. In my experience, 98% of the people who are hating on it do not have a clue what OpenAPI is, or what it does. I used to challenge folks, and try to educate them. Over the years I’ve converted a lot of folks from skeptics to believers, but in 2018, I think I’m done. If someone is openly criticizing it, I’m guessing it is more about their relationship to tech, and their lack of awareness of delivering APIs at scale, and they probably exist in a pretty entrenched position because of their existing view of the landscape–they don’t need me piling on. However, if people aren’t aware of the landscape, and ask questions about how OpenAPI works, I’m always more than happy to help open their eyes to how the API definition is serving almost every stop along the API lifecycle from design to deprecation, and everything in between.</p>
