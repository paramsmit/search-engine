  <p>These are the news items I've curated in my monitoring of the API space that have some relevance to the API definition conversation and I wanted to include in my research. I'm using all of these links to better understand how the space is defining not just their APIs, but their schema, and other moving parts of their API operations.</p>

        <p>It is an important time for API definitions. I've seen a significant uptick in the usage across the leading API definition formats, and we experienced the evolution of Swagger into the Linux Foundation, being reborn as the OpenAPI Spec. In 2016,&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that for the next wave of growth in the API sector, we need the majority of public APIs in use today, to have well crafted, as complete as possible, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions in either OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint</a>. Yes I know, we actually need all of these APIs to be crafted using hypermedia approaches, but until then we need them all to possess machine readable API definitions, making them discoverable, learnable, and consumable.</p>
<p>It is easy to get hung up on this being about <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>, but API definitions are enabling almost every step along the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">35 areas of the API life cycle I am mapping out</a>. Historically API definitions have bee used for interactive API documentation, but more recently are additionally being used to light up other aspects of API integration, such as setting up your <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a>, loading into the <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">API client</a> of your choosing, or lighting up a mock server for use in development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition enabling services and tooling throughout the life cycle, well crafted, complete API definitions is driving <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> literacy. Many API developers and architects learn by reverse engineering the APIs they know, and a well crafted <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/">OpenAPI Spec</a> or<a href="https://apiblueprint.org/"> API Blueprint</a> provides a detail blueprint for enabling this experience. API definitions make it easier to learn about good, and bad API design, in terms of the APIs you actually care about--equaling a much more open mind.</p>
<p>I've been working to define API definitions as part of my API Stack work, for over a year now. You can <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">access all the APIs.json + OpenAPI Specs + API Blueprint + Postman collections under the /data folder for the project repository</a>. Additionally, this repo is one of the sources of <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io which is an APIs.json driven open source API search engine</a>, which provides an <a href="http://apis.io/apiDoc">API for you to register and search for API definitions</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models">I saw another strong player emerge, that I'm big on supporting--APIs.guru</a>. The open source API definitions repository is looking to be the Wikipedia of API definitions, providing a single place we can find, robust, complete, API definitions in a variety of formats. They have done a lot of work to seed the repository with 196 APIs, possessing over 4000 endpoints, but they are looking to take things to the next level, and will need our help to this Wikipedia of APIs become a reality.</p>
<p>The API Stack, APIs.io, and APIs.guru all need you to help contribute, and refine the API definitions in their indexes. Developers around the world are using these definitions in their work, and modern API tooling and service providers are using them to define the value they bring to the table. To help the API sector reach the next level, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">we need you to step up and share the API definitions you have with API Stack, APIs.io, or APIs.guru</span></strong>, and if you have the time and skills, we could use your help crafting other new API definitions for popular services available today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need help getting in touch with APIs.io or APIs.guru, there is contact information on both their sites. Alternatively, feel free to just ping me with the URL of your own Github repository, and I'll make sure your API definition index gets in sync with all of this new wave of open API repositories.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2015/11/23/sharing-235k-api-definitions-with-the-english-language-api-recipe-book/">Sharing 235K API Definitions With The English Language API Recipe Book</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-copyright.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I needed a side project to reboot my mind after @APIStrat this last weekend, so I opened up my notebook and picked a project that I've been meaning to give some attention to, one that would help me clean my slate, and let me get back to my regular work levels. The project I picked is one that I came up with a little over a year ago, but recently had flushed out my vision further, as I hung out at my favorite watering whole drinking an IPA.</p>
<p>It took me several iterations before I landed on a name for this project, but my working title is <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/">the English Language API Recipe Book</a>. I find myself in an awkward position these days, when it comes to the concept of API copyright, which is something I have taken a firm stance on with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/22/what-we-can-do-to-make-a-difference-in-the-wake-of-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case/">my work around the Oracle v Google ava API copyright case</a>, and the release of the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API licensing format API Commons</a>, but is something, in the end, I just do not believe in.</p>
<p>You see, in my opinion, API definitions should NOT fall under copyright. Like recipes and menus, API definitions should not be open for anyone to use. To help me make my point, I wanted to craft <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/">the English Language API Recipe Book</a>, publishing an open API definition for almost every word in the English dictionary. I found a reasonably complete list of every English word, and auto-generated an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Open API Definition Format (OADF)</a> specification for each of the 235K+ words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each API definition, I cover the base GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs for each word, providing a basic query via a parameter, and return a name, and description as the basic underlying data model. I am already playing with other variations of database models, and have also generated another dimension for each word, by again iterating through each word, and adding it as a secondary level resource. I am also playing with other relationships, and ideas for expanding the dimensions of this recipe book, but wanted to get this first version out the door.</p>
<p><a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/english-language-dictionary-notes.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, I just want to show how easy it is to programmatically generate API definitions, and add this English Language API Recipe Book to my already growing number of API definitions, <a href="http://theapistack.com">from popular APIs that I include in the API Stack</a>. Through this work, I wanted to emphasize, that no matter how much work you put into the naming, ordering, and design of your API definitions, they are not creative works that you should lock up and defend--your API definitions should be open, easily accessible, shared, and designed for reuse.</p>
<p>While I do not think any of the 235K+ API definitions should have copyright applied, I will putting all of these into public domain, using a Creative Commons license, as act two of this production. This is more theater than anything, but using API Commons, I will make sure every word in the English dictionary, crafted as a basic web API, is available for anyone to use, anytime, anywhere (as it should be, DUH). I recently stated in a keynote, after launching API Commons, that I was going to be the "Johnny Fucking Appleseed" of publishing openly licensed API definitions, out in front of slower moving corporations like Oracle--the English Language API Recipe Book is just the beginning of this.</p>
<p>Next up, I will be crafting a series of OADF API definitions for <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a> and use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to bundles as a more meaningful collection. I will be using these data models to further automate the English Language API Recipe Book, and establish additional dimensions to this collection. <a href="https://github.com/english-language-api-recipe-book">You can find the English Language API Recipe Book on Github</a>. I have published as a Github organization, with a separate sharded repository for each letter of the alphabet, containing a separate OADF definition for each word in the dictionary, and indexed using APIs.json to index each letter, <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/apis.json">as well as for the overall recipe book collection</a>--making it all machine readable by default.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2015/10/29/api-visualization-exploration-using-api-definitions/">API Visualization Exploration Using API Definitions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apihandyman.io/swagger/swagger-specification-visual-documentation/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/swagger-specification-visual-documentation.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are number of areas across the API life-cycle that are being expanded upon in the current space, thanks to the evolution of API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML. One area I haven't seen as much growth as I'd like, is in the area of <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">visualizations driven by API definitions</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two distinct pools of API definition driven visualization: 1) Letting you visualize the surface area of an API 2) Letting you visualize the resource made available via an API. One area my friend the <a href="https://twitter.com/apihandyman">@APIHandyman</a> has been exploring is around the surface area of API.</p>
<p>@APIHandyman has a nice prototype created that he is calling "<a href="http://apihandyman.io/swagger/swagger-specification-visual-documentation/">Swagger Specification Visual Documentation</a>". The API Definition driven visualization uses A <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js visualization</a> to help you explore the surface area of any API that is defined using Swagger. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/06/my-wish-has-been-granted-swagger-driven-api-visualizations-from-ardoq/">I have written about API definition driven visualizations before</a>, so I am happy to see the concept being pushed forward, as we have a lot of iterations to cycle through before we find a visualization format(s) that works for different API designers, architects, and developers.</p>
<p>The visual documentation that @APIHandyman created runs on Github, and he is looking for feedback on the micro tool, and where he should take it next. He recently added a bigger information display area, but could use the communities ideas on how to make it more useful. This type of work is a time drain. Every time I started playing with Swagger + D3.js I would lose an entire evening, and have very little to show for work, so I know how valuable feedback can be.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/30/swagger-visualization-layer-using-d3js/">API definition driven D3.js visualizations </a>will be the future of API design, management, and orchestration. APIs are going to continue to grow in number, and scope, and we will need simple, visual ways we can quickly traverse the landscape, and makes sense of things. If you are working on an API definition driven visualization tool, either for the surface area of an API, or helping visualize the actual resources being served up, please let me know so I can showcase.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-business-dev-code.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If  you are in an industry being impacted by technology, you have probably  become very aware of the term Application Programming Interfaces, more  widely known as APIs, and how they are driving web applications, mobile  applications, and increasingly everyday  objects in our homes, cars, businesses, and across the public  landscape. If you are finding yourself part of this growing  conversations, you have most likely have also heard talk of a new breed  of API definition formats that are becoming ubiquitous like Swagger  and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>API definitions are a way to describe what an API does, providing a  machine readable blueprint of how to put the digital resource to work.  API definitions are not new, but this latest round of available formats  are taking the API conversation out of just  IT and developer groups, and enabling business units, and other key  stakeholders to participate throughout the API life-cycle. Much like the  latest wave of web APIs has made data, content, and other digital  resources like video and images more accessible,  API definitions are making APIs more accessible across the rapidly  expanding digital business landscape.</p>
<p>The first widely available API definition format was the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl"> Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</a>, which is an XML format  established in 2001 that described web services. Much like web services  (an API predecessor), WSDL was a very technical vision of APIs,  something dictated by IT, and developer groups, with  heavy top down governance from business and industry leadership. While  web services, and WSDL are still ubiquitous across the enterprise, they  are rapidly being replaced with much lighter weight, simpler web APIs  that use the Internet as a way of delivering  the digital data, content, and resources web, mobile, and devices are  demanding in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round-certified.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Along the way, newer, more web friendly API definition formats emerged, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language"> Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, but ultimately WADL was  something that never took root, suffering from many of the same illness  of its predecessor WSDL. It wasn't until a new format called <a href="http://swagger.io"> Swagger</a> was born, that we started to see the conversation around how  we define, communicate and develop standardized tooling around APIs  evolve, providing an open specification for defining all the details  that go into an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger provided developers a way to describe an API that was more in  sync with everything else modern API developers were used to, including  using JSON, rather than the XML of previous web services, WSDL and  WADL. Swagger gave us something more than just  way to define APIs, it gave us swagger UI, which is a interactive  version of API documentation that made learning about what an API does,  and how to integrate with it, a hands on, interactive experience. This  new approach to documentation gave us a solution  to the number one problem plaguing API providers, which was out of date  documentation that confused consumers.</p>
<p>Shortly after Swagger began seeing wide adoption because of the  interactive documentation it provided for APIs, a new API definition  format also emerged called API Blueprint, which provided interactive  documentation, but rather than using JSON, it used Markdown,  making the process of defining APIs a little less intimidating for  non-developers. Apiary, the makers of API Blueprint did another thing  that would move the conversation forward again, making the reasons for  defining APIs in these formats, more about API design,  than just about delivering up-to-date documentation.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-blueprint-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Using API Blueprint, API designers could define an API, before any  code was actually written. Developers could craft an API using Apiary's  tooling, then a mock version of an API could be generated, which could  be shared with other project stakeholders, from  business users, to potential web or mobile developers. This process  saves considerable time, money, and other resources in ensuring than API  would be something web, mobile, and device developers could actually  put to use. With two new API definition formats  Swagger, and now API Blueprint, the processing of defining, designing  APIs in a machine readable way, was accessible to everyone, across a  rapidly expanding API life-cycle.</p>
<p>This evolution has all occurred over the last 4 years, a period which  has also produced other API definition formats like RSDL, RADL, RAML,  I/O Docs, and MSON--just to name a few. All of these API definition  formats are quickly becoming the preferred format  for not just defining, and designing APIs, as well as delivering  documentation. Another positive by-product has been that a new breed of  API service providers are also using it as the central definition for  quickly putting their services to work on any API,  for documentation, mocking and virtualizing APIs, generating server  code, producing software development kits (SDK), and setting up  essential testing and monitoring to keep APIs stable and reliable for  consumers--the API definition driven life-cycle continues  to expand.</p>
<p>In 15 years, like APIs, the API definition formats have moved out of  the real of the technical, and are providing vital business interactions  that ensure APIs meet critical internal, partner, and public needs.  They are also being applied to bring much needed  balance to the political side of API operations, from making sure APIs  are stable, and available, to defining pricing, rate limits, terms of  service, and even helping secure APIs that operate on the open Internet.</p>
<p>API definitions have become a machine readable contract that defines  the boundaries of a relationship between API provider, and its  consumers. Acting as a central truth, that is crafted by developers and  API architects to govern how an API operates, from  mocking to client integration, but in a way that is also setting the  technical, business, and legal expectations of consumers. This API  definition-driven contact is transcending the often proprietary, black  box algorithms that make an API function behind the  scenes, providing a portable, shareable, machine readable contract that  can be shared internally, and externally with partners or the general  public.</p>
<p>The importance of this new layer, and its role in the future of software development can be seen playing out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_America,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc."> Oracle v Google API copyright case</a>, where Oracle (using the courts)  has set the precedent that the naming, and ordering of your interface is  separate from the code, and falls under copyright protection. Beyond  the core legal case, the questions, and understanding  of exactly what is code has been even more interesting. Many API  architects do not see APIs as anything but code, having not seen impacts  of the modern API definition movement within their architecture yet.</p>
<p>API definitions aren't just about defining the URLs, parameters,  headers, and other aspects of API operations that developers need to  know, it is also bringing much needed clarity and awareness of value  generated by APIs among business users, and the end-users  of the applications that APIs are powering. API definitions provide a  common format in markdown, YAML, or JSON, that describe the technical  surface of an API, but then also take this technical specification, and  allow it to be applied across every stop along  the API life-cycle, from idea to deployment, to resulting integration  with web, mobile, and device applications.</p>
<p>As APIs make their way into almost every aspect of our business and  personal lives, driving our social relationships with family and  friends, meter our connections to our utility companies, connect us to  educational and healthcare opportunities, this touch-point  between platform, and the web, mobile, and device applications it  powers, is becoming increasingly critical. To businesses this layer  represents critical supply chains, but to each individual this touch  point is where all of our life bits flow--further emphasizing  the importance of, but also the sensitivity required in defining APIs  in a meaningful way, that makes sense to EVERYONE involved.</p>
<p>In 2001, a WSDL definition was very much about communicating what a  service did between platform and an the system that was integrated,  something that only involved IT, and developers. In 2015, a modern API  definition format provides the same benefits that  WSDL has historically delivered, but it is also addressing the  business, and political elements of how Internet enabled software works.  &nbsp;A modern API definition provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>a medium for API designs, architects, and business stakeholders to  craft exactly the API that is needed, before any production code is  written. </li>
<li>a necessary set of instructions needed for a quality assurance (QA) team to make sure an API meets business requirements </li>
<li>a definition of sandbox, mocking, simulation, and virtualization environments that developers may need to be successful </li>
<li>what a developer needs to integrate with another system, or  build an application through interactive documentation, and even  complete Software Development Kits (SDK) </li>
<li>what the API testing, monitoring, and performance groups will need to ensure service level agreements are met or exceeded </li>
<li>the known surface area that security auditor will need to  properly secure the infrastructure web, mobile, devices, and ultimately  users will depend on </li>

        <h3><a href="/2015/09/07/infoworld-api-definitions/">InfoWorld - API Definitions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2015</span>
        <p>If you are in an industry being impacted by technology, you have probably become very aware of the term Application Programming Interfaces, more widely known as APIs, and how they are driving web applications, mobile applications, and increasingly everyday objects in our homes, cars, businesses, and across the public landscape. If you are finding yourself part of this growing conversations, you have most likely have also heard talk of a new breed of API definition formats that are becoming ubiquitous like Swagger and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>API definitions are a way to describe what an API does, providing a machine readable blueprint of how to put the digital resource to work. API definitions are not new, but this latest round of available formats are taking the API conversation out of just IT and developer groups, and enabling business units, and other key stakeholders to participate throughout the API life-cycle. Much like the latest wave of web APIs has made data, content, and other digital resources like video and images more accessible, API definitions are making APIs more accessible across the rapidly expanding digital business landscape.</p>
<p>The first widely available API definition format was the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</a>, which is an XML format established in 2001 that described web services. Much like web services (an API predecessor), WSDL was a very technical vision of APIs, something dictated by IT, and developer groups, with heavy top down governance from business and industry leadership. While web services, and WSDL are still ubiquitous across the enterprise, they are rapidly being replaced with much lighter weight, simpler web APIs that use the Internet as a way of delivering the digital data, content, and resources web, mobile, and devices are demanding in 2015.</p>
<p>Along the way, newer, more web friendly API definition formats emerged, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, but ultimately WADL was something that never took root, suffering from many of the same illness of its predecessor WSDL. It wasn't until a new format called <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> was born, that we started to see the conversation around how we define, communicate and develop standardized tooling around APIs evolve, providing an open specification for defining all the details that go into an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger provided developers a way to describe an API that was more in sync with everything else modern API developers were used to, including using JSON, rather than the XML of previous web services, WSDL and WADL. Swagger gave us something more than just way to define APIs, it gave us swagger UI, which is a interactive version of API documentation that made learning about what an API does, and how to integrate with it, a hands on, interactive experience. This new approach to documentation gave us a solution to the number one problem plaguing API providers, which was out of date documentation that confused consumers.</p>
<p>Shortly after Swagger began seeing wide adoption because of the interactive documentation it provided for APIs, a new API definition format also emerged called API Blueprint, which provided interactive documentation, but rather than using JSON, it used Markdown, making the process of defining APIs a little less intimidating for non-developers. Apiary, the makers of API Blueprint did another thing that would move the conversation forward again, making the reasons for defining APIs in these formats, more about API design, than just about delivering up-to-date documentation.</p>
<p>Using API Blueprint, API designers could define an API, before any code was actually written. Developers could craft an API using Apiary's tooling, then a mock version of an API could be generated, which could be shared with other project stakeholders, from business users, to potential web or mobile developers. This process saves considerable time, money, and other resources in ensuring than API would be something web, mobile, and device developers could actually put to use. With two new API definition formats Swagger, and now API Blueprint, the processing of defining, designing APIs in a machine readable way, was accessible to everyone, across a rapidly expanding API life-cycle.</p>
<p>This evolution has all occurred over the last 4 years, a period which has also produced other API definition formats like RSDL, RADL, RAML, I/O Docs, and MSON--just to name a few. All of these API definition formats are quickly becoming the preferred format for not just defining, and designing APIs, as well as delivering documentation. Another positive by-product has been that a new breed of API service providers are also using it as the central definition for quickly putting their services to work on any API, for documentation, mocking and virtualizing APIs, generating server code, producing software development kits (SDK), and setting up essential testing and monitoring to keep APIs stable and reliable for consumers--the API definition driven life-cycle continues to expand.</p>
<p>In 15 years, like APIs, the API definition formats have moved out of the real of the technical, and are providing vital business interactions that ensure APIs meet critical internal, partner, and public needs. They are also being applied to bring much needed balance to the political side of API operations, from making sure APIs are stable, and available, to defining pricing, rate limits, terms of service, and even helping secure APIs that operate on the open Internet.</p>
<p>API definitions have become a machine readable contract that defines the boundaries of a relationship between API provider, and its consumers. Acting as a central truth, that is crafted by developers and API architects to govern how an API operates, from mocking to client integration, but in a way that is also setting the technical, business, and legal expectations of consumers. This API definition-driven contact is transcending the often proprietary, black box algorithms that make an API function behind the scenes, providing a portable, shareable, machine readable contract that can be shared internally, and externally with partners or the general public.</p>
<p>The importance of this new layer, and its role in the future of software development can be seen playing out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_America,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc.">Oracle v Google API copyright case</a>, where Oracle (using the courts) has set the precedent that the naming, and ordering of your interface is separate from the code, and falls under copyright protection. Beyond the core legal case, the questions, and understanding of exactly what is code has been even more interesting. Many API architects do not see APIs as anything but code, having not seen impacts of the modern API definition movement within their architecture yet.</p>
<p>API definitions aren't just about defining the URLs, parameters, headers, and other aspects of API operations that developers need to know, it is also bringing much needed clarity and awareness of value generated by APIs among business users, and the end-users of the applications that APIs are powering. API definitions provide a common format in markdown, YAML, or JSON, that describe the technical surface of an API, but then also take this technical specification, and allow it to be applied across every stop along the API life-cycle, from idea to deployment, to resulting integration with web, mobile, and device applications.</p>
<p>As APIs make their way into almost every aspect of our business and personal lives, driving our social relationships with family and friends, meter our connections to our utility companies, connect us to educational and healthcare opportunities, this touch-point between platform, and the web, mobile, and device applications it powers, is becoming increasingly critical. To businesses this layer represents critical supply chains, but to each individual this touch point is where all of our life bits flow--further emphasizing the importance of, but also the sensitivity required in defining APIs in a meaningful way, that makes sense to EVERYONE involved.</p>
<p>In 2001, a WSDL definition was very much about communicating what a service did between platform and an the system that was integrated, something that only involved IT, and developers. In 2015, a modern API definition format provides the same benefits that WSDL has historically delivered, but it is also addressing the business, and political elements of how Internet enabled software works. &nbsp;A modern API definition provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>a medium for API designs, architects, and business stakeholders to craft exactly the API that is needed, before any production code is written.</li>
<li>a necessary set of instructions needed for a quality assurance (QA) team to make sure an API meets business requirements</li>
<li>a definition of sandbox, mocking, simulation, and virtualization environments that developers may need to be successful</li>
<li>what a developer needs to integrate with another system, or build an application through interactive documentation, and even complete Software Development Kits (SDK)</li>
<li>what the API testing, monitoring, and performance groups will need to ensure service level agreements are met or exceeded</li>
<li>the known surface area that security auditor will need to properly secure the infrastructure web, mobile, devices, and ultimately users will depend on</li>
<li>a map that government regulators can use to understand the industry landscape, and help keep all players in alignment with the nations priorities</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a sampling of how API definitions are being used as a driver for what is widely being called the API economy, which is the heart of cloud, mobile, big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and almost every other technical trend of the last ten years. While API definitions provide the much needed machine readable instructions for computers to understand what occurs at these vital API touch-points, they also provide the much needed human readable instructions, that people can use to interpret business agreements, individual relationships, that are playing out across our increasingly digital lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Aug 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-nose-disguise.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am always pleased to see API providers publishing Swagger definitions, and using them to drive their interactive documentation. Projects like the&nbsp;<a href="http://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System API</a>, are getting on the API definition bandwagon, and this is a good thing. I have been pushing API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint since 2012, but in 2015, while I want to keep on-boarding folks to the concept of using API definitions for interactive documentation, but I also want them to also understand that their APIs definition will be used in other areas of API operations as well.</p>
<p>Most people think <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> is the documentation, and have not been able able to separate the specification from the interactive documentation. I think <a href="http://apiary.ioo">Apiary</a> has done a better job of this separation with the separation of <a href="http://apiblueprint.com">API Blueprint</a> from Apiary. As an API provider, you may not have evolved to a full API-first level of operation, which is ok, but I encourage you to make your Swagger or API Blueprint definition as accessible as possible, so your API consumers can put to use in other ways--even if you don't have the time.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw that the&nbsp;<a href="http://data.globalchange.gov/">Global Change Information System API</a>&nbsp;employed Swagger for their documentation, the next thing I wanted to do was also use in my <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman client</a>. While the Swagger UI provides me with a hands-on way of getting to know the GCIS API, I have to come back to the site to play with more, and it doesn't give me as much detail about how the API works, as my Postman client does. All GCIS API team has to do, is publish a text or image link to <a href="/admin/blog/view-source:http:/data.globalchange.gov/api_reference.json">their Swagger definition</a> in a prominent location, so it is obvious to us consumers.</p>
<p>I get easily reverse engineer the Swagger UI, using my Google Developer tools, but it is a couple of extra steps for me, that stands in between me, and making calls to the GCIS API in my local Postman Client. Interactive API documentation via Swagger and Apiary has significantly moved the API definition conversation forward, but <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/thinking-beyond-just-language-specific-clients-and-also-speaking-the-formats-popular-http-clients-are-using/">just like we should be thinking beyond just language specific clients, we also need to be enabling our API consumers to speak the formats popular HTTP clients like Postman speak</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I create a lot of machine readable API definitions for the 1000 companies I monitor as part of my API Stack</a>. I am using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> to define all of my APIs, providing me with a simple, yet powerful way to profile each of the APIs I'm working to understand better. If you aren't familiar with Swagger, it provides a handful of fields you can use to fill out the metadata profile for APIs, like title, description, etc., but where it really gets powerful is when you put the paths collection to work, outline the details of each endpoint.</p>
<p>Most of the APIs I come across that are defined using Swagger, focuses on providing details on each path, including verbs, headers, parameters, and sometimes response status codes. When looking for the benefits of Swagger, many stop here. With basic metadata, and details about the paths, <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">you can launch interactive documentation using Swagger UI</a>--which is how about 80% of folks are using the API specification format.</p>
<p>When it comes to Swagger, my own motivations are all about <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, so when crafting Swagger files for the APIs I track on, I can easily call it quits after defining the basic meta information, and path details, but all of this ignores some of the exremely valuable aspect of using Swagger--with the definitions collection.</p>
<p>Using the Swagger definitions collection you can quantify the underlying data model across API operations, providing a machine readable profile of the XML and JSON that will be part of each API request and response. Once you have the underlying data model defined, including each parameter, description, and type, you can then link to each path and / or parameter, where the data model is being put to use as part of the request or response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger definition collections are not a requirement for Swagger UI, or for API discovery currently, but if you want to generate high quality server side code, or client SDKs, you will need a complete set of definitions present. The problem is, this is a shitload of work, and <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/twitter/twitter-api-swagger.json">as I face the Swagger definition for Twitter</a>, I'm looking at many hours of work if I want to ensure that Twitter's Swagger file has all of its underlying data model present, understanding why many people stop short of a complete Swagger spec.</p>
<p>In the end, the Swagger definition collections is really the cherry on top of each API I am profiling, highlighting the maturity of a particular API definition, demonstrating that you can do more with a machine readable definition, than just discovery, and documentation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jun 2015</span>

<p>Making sure the Swagger files I craft possess a complete definition for its underlying data model, one that is linked to each API path, and parameters where it is put to use, is important to me, but damn it is a lot of work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/the-swagger-definitions-collection-is-the-cherry-on-top-of-each-api-that-i-profile/">As I mentioned in my last piece</a> I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/twitter/twitter-api-swagger.json">the Twitter Swagger file</a>, and my head starts spinning thinking about how much work it will be to hand-define all of the data models that used across the almost 100 Twitter endpoints.</p>
<p>I quickly got to work finding a better solution--I landed on <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">I had downloaded and installed Charles Proxy to better understand how we could map out the dark layer of the API universe</a>, that the popular mobile applications we use depend on. When running, Charles proxies all the requests and responses my desktop apps, and browsers make on my local Macbook. I can also route my iPhone and iPad through the proxy, when I want to also record my mobile app usage. This is perfect for helping me map out the public APIs in my API Stack work!</p>
<p>When the Charles Proxy is running, it saves an XML summary export to my local Dropbox folder, which then gets synced to the cloud via the Dropbox API. I am now working on a script that will keep an eye on my Dropbox folder, and process any new Charles export files it finds. As I process each file, I'm cherry picking from the domains of specific companies that I'm tracking on, pulling out the request and response information I need to craft a Swagger definition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To generate the traffic I need, I just load up any API I'm looking to profile in <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, and started working my way through the list of endpoints, until I've covered the entire surface area of any API. I find it is easy to generate a beginning Swagger definition, which includes the host, base uRL, endpoints, and parameters, then load it into Postman, and let Charles proxy complete the rest of the Swagger definition collection, and link each one to any path or parameter it is referenced by. I will be running checks on request details, to make sure I haven't forgotten about any endpoints, and parameters, but my goal is primarily around polishing the definition collection, with an endpoint linkage.</p>
<p>I will not rely on these Swagger definitions generated from the Charles proxy. I will be queuing them up in a Github repo(s), and syncing them existing, often hand-crafted Swagger definitions I'm already evolving. Hopefully this process will help me automate the profiling of popular public APIs, and enable me to crank through more APIs this summer, as part of my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack research</a>.</p>
<p>All of this is working out well. My need to automate the defining of underlying data models, reminded me of the dark API work I was already doing with Charles Proxy--something I will spend more time on this summer. I am looking to generate a Swagger definition for each of the desktop apps I use on my MacBook, and the mobile apps I use on my iDevices--stay tuned!</p>

<p>As I work to create <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">Swagger API definitions for the almost 1000 companies in my API stack</a>, I'm chasing an elusive definition of a complete Swagger definition for any API. Only a small portion of APIs I am defining using Swagger will reach an 80-90% completions status, in reality most will never be complete for reasons that are totally out of my control.</p>
<p>When it comes to crafting API definitions for public APIs, I may be able to get the API definition complete in the sense that it has all the paths, parameters, responses, definitions, and security configurations, but if the API itself is missing pieces--the API definition will always be incomplete (in perpetuity).</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">As I work to automate the questions I ask of Swagger definitions</a>, helping me get to a more <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">coherent definition of what is a complete Swagger definition</a>, I can't help feel the need to offer API design tips to the API providers I am profiling. Honestly I have never considered myself a high quality API designer, I've been more business than tech, but I can't help pointing out the obvious stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still using my API definition tooling for my own goals around defining <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, but because I'm building it all as APIs, I intend to open it up to others for analyzing their own API definitions, determining how complete they are, and potentially offering up tips on what could be done to improve them. A kind of self-service, API design tip API, that helps with some of the most common elements that are missing from API designs.</p>
<p>In 2015, API definitions are opening up a buffet of services that are courting API providers ranging from mocking and deployment, to monitoring and security. I don't see why API definitions couldn't also allow for professional API designers to help API providers evolve their APIs in a more constructive ways, from the outside-in. Using Swagger or API Blueprint, professional designers could easily provide suggestions for existing API providers and their designs, then give them potential suggestions that they could use in their API design road-map.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, food for thought!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a> and I have been working hard to craft <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files for the top public APIs out there, including machine readable Swagger definitions, ever since <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">we launched the open source API search engine APIs.io</a>. We will keep working to define, and index the API space, but it is a lot of work ahead, and we could use some help.</p>
<p>Over the last couple months I've had several conversations with folks about the need for <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprints</a> for popular APIs, so that the community can build valuable tooling and services on top of commonly used APIs. Two companies who I've been talking to are&nbsp;<a href="http://apimatic.io">SDK generation service APIMATIC</a>, and <a href="http://blockspring.com">API spreadsheet integration provider BlockSpring</a>.</p>
<p>APIMATC wants see better quality Swagger definitions emerge, so they can build client SDKs that work, and make available via <a href="http://sdks.io">SKDs.io</a>. BlockSpring wants to be able to integrate popular API content, data, and functionality into Google Spreadsheets, using their slick plugin. These are just two examples of services that are emerging to deliver much needed functionality on top of APIs -- if we can establish a rich, open, machine readable repository of API definitions, it will open up the flood gates for even more API tooling and services. #win</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">I've added some new information to the API Stack to support this effort</a>. So far <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">I have&nbsp;917 companies, in 223 areas, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions.</a> I want all 917 companies to have all their APIs fully defined using APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprint by the end of the summer, as well as any important companies that are not listed. It is a lofty goal, but I think with some help, we can do it.</p>
<p>As a working group, we have several challenges, that we are hoping to work out in real-time via the <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">API Stack Github repository</a>. First we have to actually do the heavy lifting of generating APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprints, but we also have to also define a process for what is considered a "complete API definition"--I'll be working through these thoughts separately.</p>
<p>Now that I am done traveling, I will be dedicating a considerable amount of time to this work in June. If you want to get involved, <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">please participate via the API Stack site and Github repository</a>, or feel free to ping me directly.

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/03/significance-of-the-we-the-people-api-being-first-modern-read--write-web-api-in-government/">A topic I've written about before</a>, and one that I answer regularly on forums, via email, and on Twitter is, &ldquo;Are there any write APIs in the federal government?&rdquo; It is a valid question, and as I said in my <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/next-us-government-api-strategy/">strategy suggestions for the federal government,</a> write APIs are a critical aspect of all of this moving forward in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Rebecca Williams (<a href="https://twitter.com/internetrebecca">@internetrebecca</a>) pointed me to a <a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/4466/are-there-good-examples-of-open-read-write-apis-in-federal-government">recent discussion on this topic</a> earlier today, to which I added a couple of suggestions, but ultimately it is something I would like to see a more progressive solution emerge, something that can answer it real-time, and change as the API inventory in the federal government changes and evolves. Keeping a list, <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes">like 18F is doing</a>, is a start, but we need more.</p>
<p>One of the side projects that I work on a couple of hours each week, is the profiling of federal government APIs using APIs.json, and Swagger, for use in my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/stack.html">federal API stack</a>. I only have a handful of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">120+ APIs that I&rsquo;m profiling</a> completed, but once done, you will be able to search for APIs based upon whether or not an API uses the verbs GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE&mdash;giving you a much more detailed picture of how government APIs function.</p>
<p>Generating machine readable API definitions in Swagger and API Blueprint are time consuming, but once you tie it together using a discovery format like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, it opens up a lot more opportunity to answer questions about government APIs. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of the heavy lifting currently, to establish a critical mass of API definitions in federal government, then I am hoping that each agency will take ownership over maintaining their own definitions--if not, I think it can just as easily be done from the outside-in, by the community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for the potential, when all of the meta-layer of APIs and open data in government is rich, well defined, and machine readable by default. The continuing data.json work out of the government, and our own APIs.json format is looking to help with this over time. There is a lot of work ahead, as well as education to occur, before the meta data layer for government APIs is machine readable by default, but once it is, we&rsquo;ll be able to answer questions like this in a much more efficient way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2015</span>

<p>This post has been open for almost two weeks now in Evernote. It began as a simple story about the possibility for generating code samples and libraries using Swagger. The longer it stays open, the wider the definition becomes, so I have to post something, just to draw a line in the sand. I&rsquo;m not talking about generating code that runs on the server, this post is all about everything on the API consumption side of things.</p>
<p>Shortly after Wordnik launched the machine readable API definition format&nbsp;<a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, they launched a <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">library for generating client side code samples in a variety of languages</a>. This was something that was evolved upon by <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, with the launch of their API design platform, and introduction of <a href="http://bit.ly/1arUHCU">API Blueprint</a>. Even with these advances forward, there were still many shortcomings, and debate around what you could actually auto-generate on the client-side using a machine readable API definition continued. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many random Tweets I get from people saying, &ldquo;Oh is auto-generation of code cool again?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t auto-generate client code or SDKs ;-)"</p>
<p>Amidst the debate about what is really possible, and the jokes about our SOA past, new players have emerged like <a href="http://bit.ly/1qnXcI0">Apimatic</a> that are looking to raise the bar when it comes to generation of not just simple code samples, libraries or stubs, but sophisticated API SDKs. I am sure the jokes about automating client code will still occurs, but there is no denying that the overall conversation is moving forward.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m exploring my own limitations of what is possible when generating client-side code with Swagger, I also come across new players like <a href="http://bit.ly/1DwAaXo">Lucybot</a>, who are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/24/driving-your-single-page-applications-and-api-cookbooks-using-api-definition-formats-like-swagger-and-api-blueprint/">moving the conversation forward with API cookbooks, and Single Page App (SPA) generated from Swagger definitions</a>. I&rsquo;m not in denial that there is a lot of work ahead, but in the two weeks that I&rsquo;ve been crafting this post, I&rsquo;d say I have gotten a glimpse of what is next. When you bundle the latest movements in virtualization and containerization, and using API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint to auto-generate client side code, I feel like the current potential is unlimited, and things are just heating up.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aglio-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm on the hunt for new ways to deploy attractive, interactive API documentation, from machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. I am <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">advocating for the development of new approaches to deploy UI documentation</a>, and part of this showcasing what I find along the way.</p>
<p>In the spotlight today is <a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio">Aglio</a>, which they describe as:</p>
<blockquote><em>An API Blueprint renderer that supports multiple themes and outputs static HTML that can be served by any web host. API Blueprint is a Markdown-based document format that lets you write API descriptions and documentation in a simple and straightforward way.</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aglio-html-docs.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Aglio is significant because it is driven from the machine readable format API Blueprint, and produces static HTML that can be served up anywhere, specifically on Github or Amazon S3 deployed using Jekyll. Additionally it just makes your document simple, easy to follow, and just damn sexy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a Swagger generated version of Aglio, allowing you to deploy the attractive API documentation from both Swagger or API Blueprint. If more API documentation looked like Aglio, I would be a seriously happy camper.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m profiling all the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I monitor across the space</a>, going through each one and defining their API program, evaluating the tech, business and politics of their operations. Part of this process is creating a Swagger definition for each API. I&rsquo;m not deeply concerned with getting each API definition 100%, unless I'm directly integrating with the aPI. For this round I&rsquo;m looking at defining just the surface area of the API, including each endpoint, headers, parameters, and body format, and leaving the underlying data model for another time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publishing all of my API definitions to the API Stack Github repository</a>. I&rsquo;m using this as a staging area before I publish them to <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Last month <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2014/11/apis-io-hit-front-page-of-hacker-news/">I create an APIs.son for 690 APIs</a>, and I&rsquo;m looking to generate as many Swagger definitions for these high value APIs as I can over the holidays. It would be much better if API providers generated, and maintained their own API definitions, but until that happens I&rsquo;m happy doing a little extra work to get us to a critical mass.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-two.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Feel free to use any of my Swagger specifications, all that I ask is if you update, or add to them, please commit back to the repository so everyone can benefit. Additionally if you have any Swagger definitions for your own APIs, or other public APIs that I do not have in my listings, please share. It is extremely important that all public API endpoints are defined in a machine readable format. I don&rsquo;t care if you use Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML, just make sure your APIs have a definition, and it is shared publicly. If it is one of your designs, make sure and also add to API Commons.</p>
<p>When I reach a critical mass of <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API definitions in the API Stack Github repo</a>, I will publish a story on apievangelist.com announcing they are there, and do incremental pushes to APIs.io, so that these value APIs are part of its open index, allowing you to build API collections, and even your open API search engine. Its important that we all <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">work to define this layer of the API space, and work to keep it as open, and machine readable as possible</a>.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/gluecon">#Gluecon</a> in Colorado the other week, I have API design on the brain. A portion of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/keeping-the-api-conversation-moving-forward-at-the-gluecon-apistrat-unworkshops/">#APIStrat un-workshops were dedicated to API design related discussion</a>, and <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API Design</a> is also the most trafficked portion of API Evangelist this year, according to my Google Analytics.</p>
<p>At #Gluecon, 3Scale and API Evangelist announced our new <a href="http://apisjson.org">API discovery project APIs.json</a>, and associated tooling, <a href="http://apis.io">API search engine APIs.io</a>. For APIs.json, APIs.io, and API Commons to work, we are counting API providers, and API consumers creating machine readable API definitions.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I wanted to do some exploration--what would be possible incentives for creating machine readable API definitions?</p>

<p>The importance of having an API definition of available resources, is increasing. It was hard to realize the value of defining APIs with the heavy, top down defined WSDL, and even its web counterpart WADL, but with these new approaches, other incentives are emerging&mdash;incentives that live throughout the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>The first tangible shift in this area was when Swagger released the Swagger UI, providing interactive documentation that was generated from a Swagger API definition. Apiary quickly moved the incentives to an earlier stage in the API design lifecycle with design, mocking and collaboration opportunities.</p>
<p>As the API design world continues to explode, I&rsquo;m seeing a number of other incentives emerge for API providers to generate machine readable API definitions, and looking to find any incentives that I&rsquo;m missing, as well as identify any opportunities in how I can encourage API designers to generate machine readable API definitions in whatever format they desire.</p>

<p>In January I started taking a closer look at the world of API design, by reviewing the top movers in the space, <a href="http://bit.ly/1kFrKF0">Swagger</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1kFrINy">Wordnik</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/16ZTZYt">RAML</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtmiF9">Mulesoft</a>. My goal was to quantity the world of API design, and help me understand where it might be going, or where there are opportunities for new tools and services.</p>
<p>My intention is to write a white paper on API Design, but haven&rsquo;t reached this point, with the crazy amount of events and travel I&rsquo;ve had in the last couple months. Looking back, at where I left off in my research, the major difference between providers was that Swagger was JSON, and didn't have all the tooling that was available with API Blueprint and RAML.</p>
<p>Fast forward 60 days, and I find myself at Gluecon, hanging out with Tony Tam of Reverb, creator of Swagger. On the last day of the conference,Tony shows me the new Swagger editor, with a new focus on YAML, as well as JSON Swagger definitions.  With one release Tony addresses any gap in the space, leveling the API design playing field between API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML.</p>
<p>While there are many differences between each providers, which you can see in my reposting of  <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/api-definitions-how-do-they-model-rest/">Ole Lensmar of SmartBear explored in his talk at #APIStrat Amsterdam with how they model REST</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/03/api-definitions-what-is-behind-the-name">what is behind the name</a>, each of these top API design solutions will get you there, it just depends on your preferences.</p>
<p>60 days ago I would say that RAML and API Blueprint had a leg up on Swagger because of markdown / YAML focus, and with the amount of tooling they had. With one release Swagger has closed the gap, and with the traction they have amongst developers with a first mover advantage, this could put them squarely in the lead for adoption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m predicting I&rsquo;ll have more time this month to finish up my API design research, and produce the first draft of the white paper. API design is proving to one of the most talked about areas of the API sector in 2014, and one I&rsquo;m enjoying tracking on.</p>

<p>Last week at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">#APIStrat Amsterdam</a>, I moderated, and presented in a session that was called API service descriptions. I gave the talk for the first 15 minutes, then Sumit Sharma (<a href="https://twitter.com/sumitcan">@sumitcan</a>), Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>), and Ruben Verborgh (<a href="https://twitter.com/RubenVerborgh">@RubenVerborgh</a>) followed me-- the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqQxM6PAuh0">full video is on Youtube</a> if you are interested.</p>
<p>Over the last couple months I've been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">doing a deeper dive</a> into the area of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, with a specific look at API definition formats from <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="/admin/blog/RAML">RAML</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger</a>, so the session was intended to help me continue the conversation, in person, on the stage at #APIStrat Amsterdam. I'm happy I did, because Ole came to the table with some valuable data on API definitions, that save me some valuable research hours.</p>
<p>I'm breaking up his work into several smaller posts, you can find his <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/SmartBear_Software/api-strat-2014metadataformatsshort">full deck on slideshare</a>, first up is a comparison overview of each API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger:</p>

<p>Ole provides a nice overview of the three leading API definition formats, giving API providers a good side-by-side summary that can be used when deciding which format to support. I will work with Ole to help keep the numbers up to date, and include in my final research white paper for API design when finished.</p>
<p>Thank you too&nbsp;Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>) and <a href="http://smartbear.com/">Smartbear Software</a> for doing this research, and allowing me to share it with you.</p>

<p>I think the title of this blog post has the most occurrence of API, I&rsquo;ve ever used.  We have had requests to provide an API for the API commons, so now you can add API definitions using a Github manifest, the API Commons Manifest generator, or via the <a href="https://api-commons.3scale.net/docs">API Commons API</a>.</p>
<p>I added the ability to search API definitions, as well as POST an API through the new interface. I deployed a simple registration form for the API using <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, and will add more account management features as the API matures&mdash;right now can just signup, login, get your keys and logout.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to integrate the publishing of API definitions directly to the commons from your API management system let us know, we are happy to help you with the integration, and keeping the latest version of your API definitions published to the commons automatically.</p>
<p>If you run into any issues or have comments you can <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-commons/issues">submit via the issue management for the Github repository</a> that the API Commons site runs in.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">The Evolving Motivations Behind API Definitions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-evolving.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time diving into the evolving world of API design over the next couple of weeks. There is a rapidly emerging community of companies, tooling and approaches to designing and developing APIs, that is centered around API definition languages.</p>
<p>Languages for defining web services have been around for a while, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, which was born out of the SOAP WSDL era, representing very technical approach to describing this new world of web APIs. While WADL is still in use, it hasn&rsquo;t seen the adoption many envisioned.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until recently that we&rsquo;ve seen new approaches emerge, and get traction, with JSON based API definitions like <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> from <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, and <a href="http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs">I/O Docs</a> from <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>. The primary motivation behind defining your API using Swagger or I/O Docs has historicaly been to deploy interactive documentation for developers, with discovery, client-side code generation, server-side code generation and other tooling as secondary motivator, if at all.</p>
<p>In the last year we&rsquo;ve also seen even newer approaches to designing and defining APIs emerge, with the introduction of markdown based API definitions like <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> from <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a> from <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a>. This new markdown approach is&nbsp;providing languages for describing and defining APIs that holds the promise of even being accessible to non-developers.</p>
<p>I have time scheduled to talk with each of the providers listed above in the coming weeks, but after a talk with the API Blueprint team from Apiary, I&rsquo;m reminded of how the motivations for API definitions is continuing its rapid expansion. When you are motivated to use API definitions for just generating API documentation, you miss so much opportunity for communicating, collaborating and iterating during the planning and design of your API.</p>
<p>API Blueprint was born out of Apiary, so it is rooted in the desire to design and mockup APIs, all while collaborating with other key players and the actual consumers of the API. If you wait to generate an API definition when you reach the point where you are ready for documentation, you are throwing away valuable design time, and burning costly development hours. Apiary needed a way to articulate, share and communicate around the design of an API from start to finish, pushing the motivation for developers to generate an API definition, from producing interactive docs, to devliering on the entire API planning, design, development, deployment and management lifecycle.</p>
<p>We need these new languages to describe and communicate around APIs. Without them we can&rsquo;t mockup, iterate and collaborate to find the best possible API design. Without these new languages we can&rsquo;t quantify APIs to key business, marketing, and sales players, as well as the lawyers, providing a contract for not just machine to machine interaction, but B2B and B2C. Without these new languages we can&rsquo;t generate standardized tooling and API deployments based upon the best API patterns available today.</p>
<p>I think that the fact that there are now 4 major API design approaches, represents not just an evolution in the motivation for developers to use common definitions for APIs, but also a shift that will make API design accessible to everyone, motivating even non-developers to communicate and interact with APIs, in a simple, but powerful way that can align IT and development, with overall business goals.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/openi-logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am tracking on 2000 APIs that I have deemed worthy enough to pay attention, out of the 9000 on <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, 13,000 in <a href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> and numerous APIs in <a href="http://mashape.com">Mashape's marketplace</a>.  In addition to these APIs, I'm also closely watching <a title="backend as a service providers" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">30+ backend as a service providers</a>, <a title="reciprocity providers" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">20+ reciprocity providers</a> and emerging big data, analysis, visualization and other emerging platforms who are using APIs in new ways.</p>
<p>I was reading some of the great research coming out of <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>, which is a "Open-Source, Web-Based, Framework for Integrating Applications with Cloud-based Services and Personal Cloudlets"--specifically the post on <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/openi-api-framework-part-i-studying-the-landscape-of-cloud-based-services/">OpenI API Framework: Studying the Landscape of Cloud-Based Services</a>.</p>
<p>What is great about OPENi, is they are doing all this research and planning, and sharing the process with everyone publicly.  Which is great for everyone, but will take some time to play out, as they study, plan and execute in the space.</p>
<p>As I watch aggregate API providers like <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> plow forward and reciprocity providers like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> deliver some amazing integrations, using APIs, and bridging some of the most meaningful cloud platforms in our world--I can't help but think about how much redundant work is going on amongst startups.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/openi-api-framework-part-i-studying-the-landscape-of-cloud-based-services/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/OPENi-Blog-API1.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to the definitions of specific APIs, the nuances of their interface and authentication, each of these service providers is doing their own work, in a silo. In a perfect world, API providers would provide Swagger definitions, standard oAuth implementations, etc.  API owners would do a lot of the legwork for these providers. &nbsp;As we know, this isn't the reality, and each of these aggegrators, reciprocity providers, analytics tools are all mapping these API connections on their own.</p>
<p>I can't help but think about, how if providers stepped up, communicated with each other, they could establish some sort of commons for all of these API definitions to reside. &nbsp;They could colloaborately develop a way they could identify the meaningful APIs, hang Swagger definitions and code for connecting and authenticating in a multitude of programming languages.</p>
<p>Each provider could still maintain their secret sauce, what happens before and after each API connection, allowing them to have their own unique approach to API aggregation, reciprocity, analysis, visualization or real-time tools. But by sharing the API definitions and working together on the connections, they could spend more time on what makes their companies unique, rather than hand-rolling each API connection in isolation.</p>
<p>Just some random thoughts, as I navigate the world of APIs, from within my own silo!</p>
