<p>In 2017 <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/10/hoping-schema-becomes-just-as-important-as-api-definitions-in-2017/">I think that getting our act together when it comes to our data&nbsp;schema</a> will prove to be just as important as getting it together when it comes to our API definitions and design. This is one reason I'm such a big fan of using OpenAPI to define our APIs because it allows us to better organize the schema of the data included as part of the API request and response structure. So I am happy to see <a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/02/28/introducing-the-new-data-editor/">Postman announce their new data editor</a>, something I'm hoping will help us make sense of the schema we are using throughout our API operations.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor provides us with some pretty slick data management UI features including&nbsp;drag and drop, a wealth of useful keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, and other timesaving features. Postman has gone a long way to inject awareness into how we are using APIs over the last couple of years, and the data editor will only continue developing this awareness when it comes to the data we are passing back and forth. Lord knows&nbsp;we need all the help we can get&nbsp;when it comes to getting our data backends in order.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor makes me happy, but I'm most optimistic about what it will enable, and what Postman has planned as part of their roadmap. They end their announcement with <em>"we</em><span><em>&nbsp;have a LOT of new feature releases planned to build on top of this editor, capabilities inspired by things you already do </em>using<em>&nbsp;spreadsheets"</em>. For me, this points to some features that would directly map to the most ubiquitous data tools out there--the spreadsheet. With a significant&nbsp;portion of business in the world is done via spreadsheets, it makes the concept of integration into the API toolchain a pretty compelling thing.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_12_at_9.16.57_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was learning more about <a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a> from the Google team last week, while at the Google Community Summit, as well as the API Craft SF Meetup. I'm still learning about gRPC, and how it contributes to the API conversation, so I am trying to share what I learn as I go, keeping a record for others to learn from&nbsp;along the way. One thing I wanted to better understand was something I kept hearing regarding gRPC delivering more of a tighter API contract between API provider and consumer.</p>
<p>In contrast to more RESTful APIs, a gRPC client has to be generated by the provider. First, you define a service in a .proto file (aka Protocol Buffer), then you generate client code using the protocol buffer compiler. Where client SDKs are up for debate in the world of RESTful APIs, and client generation might even be frowned upon in some circles, when it comes to gRPC APIs, client generation is a requirement--dictating a much&nbsp;tighter coupling and contract, between API provider and consumer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have the first-hand experience with this process yet, I am just learning from my discussions last week, and trying to understand how gRPC is different from the way we've been doing APIs using a RESTful approach. So far it seems like you might want to consider gRPC if you are looking for significant levels of performance from your APIs, in situations where you have a tighter relationship with your consumers, such as internal, or partner scenarios. gRPC requires a tighter API contract between provider and consumer, something that might not always be possible, depending on the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm still getting up to speed, it seems to me that the .proto file, or the protocol buffer definition acts as the language for this API contract. Similar to how <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI is quickly becoming a contract for more RESTful API</a>s, although it is often times much looser contract. I'll keep investing time into learning about gRP, but. I wanted to make sure and process what I've learned leading up to, and while at Google this last week. I'm not convinced yet that gRPC is the future of APIs, but I am getting more convinced <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/10/focus-on-having-a-robust-and-diverse-api-toolbox/">that it is another important tool in our API toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was following <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/pull/1445">the discussion around adding a&nbsp;WebAPI class</a> to Schema.org's core vocabulary, and it got me to think more about the role Schema.org has to play with not just our API definitions, but also significantly influencing API discovery. Meaning that we should be using Schema.org as part of our OpenAPI definitions, providing us with a common vocabulary for communicating around our APIs, but also empowering the discovery of APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I describe the relationship between Schema.org to API discovery, I'm talking about using <a href="http://pending.webschemas.org/WebAPI">the pending WebAPI class</a>, but I'm also talking about using common Schema.org org within API definitions--something that will open the definitions to discovery because it employs a common schema. I am also talking about how do we leverage this vocabulary in our HTML pages, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">helping search engines like Google understand there is an API service available</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4fd35c3a5ab20881f86283bc001137ab.js"></script>
<p>I&nbsp;will also be exploring how I can better leverage Schema.org in <a href="http://apisjson.org">my APIs.json&nbsp;format</a>, better leveraging a common vocabulary describing API operations, not just an individual API. I'm looking to expand the opportunities for discovering, not limit them. I would love all APIs to take a page from the hypermedia playbook, and have a machine readable index for each API, with a set of links present with each response, but I also want folks to learn about APIs through Google, ensuring they are indexed in a way that search engines can comprehend.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> I am primarily invested in APIs.json (because it's my baby) describing API operations, and <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> to describe the surface area of an API, but I also want this to map to the very SEO driven world we operate in right now. I will keep investing time in helping folks use Schema.org in their API definitions (APIs.json&nbsp;&amp; OpenAPI), but I will also start investing in folks employing JSON+LD and Schema.org as part of their search engine strategies (like above), making our APIs more discoverable to humans as well as other systems.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/managing_grpc_apis_with_google_cloud_endpoints_3_638.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been learning more about the way Google designs and defines their APIs after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">their release of their API design guide</a>. When I research a company's APIs I always spend time looking through their Github repositories for anything interesting, and while poking around in Google's I found a repository of "<a href="https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis">interface definitions for a small (but growing) set of Google APIs</a>". I keep track of any Github repo I find containing API definitions, but Google's repo stood out because it contained a set of API definitions that covered both APIs that support both REST and gRPC.</p>
<p>Straight from the Github repo, they support two ways of access APIs: <em>"Google APIs use&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">Protocol Buffers</a>&nbsp;version 3 (proto3) as their Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the payload messages. The same interface definition is used for both REST and RPC versions of the API, which can be accessed over different wire protocols."</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>JSON over HTTP: You can access Google APIs directly using JSON over HTTP, using&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-libraries">Google API client libraries&nbsp;</a>or third-party API client libraries.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Protocol Buffers over gRPC: You can access Google APIs published in this repository through&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/grpc">GRPC</a>, which is a high-performance binary RPC protocol over HTTP/2. It offers many useful features, including request/response multiplex and full-duplex streaming.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the first example of this I've seen in the wild, and it feels like we are shifting from an HTTP to an HTTP/2&nbsp;API world. I don't think regular old REST or web APIs are going anywhere, I think they'll continue to be a staple, but it looks like Google is laying the groundwork for two-speed APIs, that are defined using a common API definition--you pick the speed you need. I've been hearing tales of gRPC usage for a while and seeing more APIs defined using protocol buffers, but Google's approach signals a wider more significant shift for me.</p>
<p>I'm still learning about gRPC, so I can't quite visualize the overlap between&nbsp;gRPC and REST quite yet. I'm going through their API definitions because they provide an interesting snapshot of the surface area of these hybrid APIs. As I spend my week in San Francisco for Google Next, I'm eager to learn more about their evolving approach to designing and defining APIs--something that I think will be setting the tone for API design at scale in the near future.</p>

        <p>I just wanted to take a moment and highlight some folks who are doing interesting things with APIs. I spend a lot of time focusing on the companies, products, and services from&nbsp;the sector, but I don't talk a lot about individual people. So I wanted to pause for a moment and just highlight a couple of people doing really interesting things with APIs right now.</p>
<p>If have been paying attention to API definitions in the last year, then you probably have come across APIs.guru, <a href="https://apis.guru/openapi-directory/">the Wikipedia for APIs</a>. They have 244 OpenAPI definitions available in their catalog, which&nbsp;is the most comprehensive directory of machine readable API definitions out there. If you have an OpenAPI for your API you should be <a href="https://apis.guru/browse-apis/">publishing it to APIs.guru</a>. if you don't, you should be creating one, and then publishing it to APIs.guru.</p>
<p>Here are the hardworking, API-savvy folks behind APIs.guru:</p>

<p>I am in the middle of a project where I am building on the work these two have invested in with APIs.guru. I'm hoping that with the next wave of this work, I'll have some complete API definitions I can contribute to APIs.guru. I encourage you to make sure your API definitions are published to the directory so that other people like me can include your APIs in our work.</p>
<p class="p2">Beyond the APIs.guru directory, <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory">I recommend checking out their Github repository, as they are doing some interesting things with GraphQL</a>. If you need help crafting an API definition for your API platform, or in need of other API advice, I recommend messaging the APIs.guru team.

<p>I've just started adding the tools I have in my database. I only have 37 so far, but will be adding more as I have time. Once I have it up to date, I will start thinking about other ways to slice and dice the tools, to better understand what is being built on the OpenAPI specification, what tools are being built on the upcoming 3.0 version, as well as working to identify where the gaps and opportunities are for developing tooling.</p>

<p>I come across more companies managing their <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> definition as a single Github repository. One example of this is from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">the New York Times</a>, who as <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs">the API definitions for their platform available as its own Github repository</a>. It demonstrates the importance of maintaining your API definitions separately from any particular implementation, such as just your documentation.</p>
<p>You can find Individual OpenAPIs for their&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/archive_api">archive_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/commit/dd0716a5adc93f95eb4b065ddd8601ffd17cb09c">updated description</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/article_search">article_search</a>,<a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/books_api">books_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/community">community</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/geo_api">geo_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/most_popular_api">most_popular_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/movie_reviews">movie_reviews</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/semantic_api">semantic_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/times_tags">times_tags</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/timeswire">timeswire</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/top_stories">top_stories</a>&nbsp;broken down into separate folders within the Github repository. The NYT also provides markdown documentation, alongside the machine-readable OpenAPI definition in each folder, helping make sure things are human-readable.</p>
<p>It just makes sense to manage your API definitions this way. It's more than just documentation. When you do this, you are taking advantage of the repository and version control features of Github, but you also open things up for participation through forking and pull requests. The resulting definition and machine readable contract can then be injected anywhere into the integration&nbsp;and API lifecycle, internally or externally.</p>
<p>I personally like it when companies manage their API definitions in this way. It gives me a central truth to work with when profiling their operations, something that will be used across my research and storytelling. The more you describe your APIs in this way, the more chance I will be writing about them&nbsp;and including them across my work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_26_at_7.12.16_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was learning about the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">AWS Serverless Developer </a><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">Portal</a>, and found their API plan layer to be an interesting evolution in how we define the access tiers of our APIs. There were a couple different layers of AWS's approach to deploying APIs that I found interesting, including the AWS marketplace integration, but I wanted to stop for a moment and focus in on their API plan approach.</p>
<p>Using the AWS API Gateway you can establish a variety of API plans, with the underlying mechanics of that plan configurable via the AWS API Gateway user interface or the AWS API Gateway API. In the documentation for the&nbsp;AWS Serverless Developer&nbsp;Portal, they include a JSON snippet of the configuration of the plan for each API being deployed.</p>
<p>This reminds me that I needed to take another look at <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">my API plan research</a>, and take the plan configuration, rate limit, and other&nbsp;service composition API definitions I have, and aggregate their schema into a single snapshot. <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">It has been a while since I worked on my machine-readable API plan definition</a>, and there are now enough API management solutions with an API layer out there, I should be able to pull a wider sampling of the&nbsp;schema in play. I'm not in the business of defining what the definition should be, I am only looking to aggregate what others are doing.</p>
<p>I am happy to see more folks sharing machine-readable <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> definitions describing the surface area of their APIs. As this work continues to grow we are going to have to also start sharing machine-readable definitions of the monetization, plan, and access layers of our API operations. After I identify the schema in play for some of the major <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> providers I track on, I'm going to invest more work into my standard API plan definition to make the access levels of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs more discoverable using APIs.json</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_19_at_9.04.43_pm.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I enjoy learning from the OpenAPI Specs of the API providers I track on. Just having an OpenAPI Spec present tells a lot about an API provider in my book, but the level of detail some providers put into their API definitions adds another level to this for me. While reviewing <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/swagger/spec/public_doc_guest.json">the OpenAPI Spec for the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, I noticed their robust usage of the OpenAPI Spec parameters definitions collection, which provides an interesting overview of the surface area of the API, augmenting the benefits brought to the table by the definitions collection of an APIs underlying data schema.</p>
<p>When you are defining each path for an API you can either define the parameters using each paths parameters, or you can add them to the overall parameters definition object, allowing them to be reused across all paths. This object provided me with a centralized place to learn about the parameters used when making calls to the Oxford Dictionary API, and I'm assuming it helped them be more organized in how they defined the surface area of their APIs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_19_at_9.04.05_pm.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I can see how the processing of defining each path's parameters, and centrally organizing them for reuse can be a healthy thing. The more you lift yourself out of the individual&nbsp;definition&nbsp;of each path&nbsp;and consider the parameter patterns that have been used for other paths, the chances you will have a better view of the landscape will increase. I am optimistic about this OpenAPI Spec object, and curious about how it can be evolved as part of other conversation around GraphQL--something I'll work to understand better in the future.</p>

<p>I am going through <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com">the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, learning about this valuable resource. Their onboarding process for registration, and learning about what the API does using interactive documentation, is very smooth. One of the things that really cuts the rough edges off learning about each API are the enums that are available for each path.</p>
<p>The parameters required for making calls to many of the paths, like language and country, have their enum values populated as part of <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/swagger/spec/public_doc_guest.json">their API definition</a>. I look at numerous OpenAPI Specs in the course of my work&nbsp;and they rarely have values present for enum, providing critical default values for developers to use--eliminating some often serious frustration.</p>
<p>Not having the right values available when making even the simplest of API calls can be a significant point of friction when trying to get up and running using an API. While it may seem like a small thing, the work the <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com">Oxford Dictionaries API</a> team has put into this level of detail for their API definitions will go a long way towards making their API resources more accessible and usable.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">I have been playing around with different ways of using Google Spreadsheet to drive YAML and JSON data to Jekyll data projects hosted as Github repositories</a>. It is an approach <a href="http://government.services.adopta.agency/">I started playing around with in Washington DC, while I was helping data stewards publish government services as JSON-LD</a>. It is something I've been playing around with lately using to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">drive D3.js visualizations</a>&nbsp;and even <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/teh-jigz-up/two/">a comic book</a>.</p>
<p>There are couple of things going on here. First, you are managing machine-readable data using Google Spreadsheets, and publishing this data as two separate machine readable formats: JSON and YAML. When these formats are combined with the data capabilities of a Jekyll website hosted on Github Pages, it opens up some pretty interesting possibilities for using data to fuel some pretty fun things. Plus...no backend needed.</p>
<p>To push this approach forward I wanted to apply&nbsp;to managing <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Specs</a> that can be used across the API life cycle. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dDrCFm8C2jtAkTm4zw86YJeREyCs9Vq49dAQeLiTxtg/pubhtml">I pulled together a spreadsheet template for managing the details I need for an OpenAPI Spec</a>. Then I created a Github repository, forked my previous spreadsheet to YAML project, and modified it to <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/openapi-spec-google-spreadsheet-to-jekyll-github-yaml">pull data from a couple of worksheets in the Google Doc&nbsp;and publish as both JSON and YAML OpenAPI Spec</a>s.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/openapi-spec-google-spreadsheet-to-jekyll-github-yaml/">My OpenAPI Spec Google Sheet to YAML for use in a Jekyll project hosted on Github is just a prototype</a>. The results don't always validate, and I'm playing with different ways to represent and manage the data in the Google Sheet. It is a fun start though! I am going to keep working on it, and probably start a similar project for managing an APIs.json&nbsp;index using Google Sheets. When done right it might provide another way that non-developers can participate in the API design process, and apply OpenAPI Specs to other stops along the API life cycle like with API documentation, SDK generation, or testing and monitoring.</p>

        <p>I was profiling the New Relic API, and while I was pleased to <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-waiter.png">find OpenAPI Specs behind their explorer</a>, I was less than pleased to have to reverse engineer their docs to get at their API definitions. It is pretty easy to open up my Google Chrome Developer Tools and grab the URLs for each OpenAPI Spec, but you know what would be easier? If you just provided me a link to them in your documentation!</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_01_at_12.43.12_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Your API definitions aren't just driving the API documentation on your website. They are being used across the API life cycle. I am using them fire up and playing with your API in <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a>, generating SDKs using <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, or creating a <a href="https://getsandbox.com/">development sandbox</a> so I do not have to develop against your&nbsp;live environment. Please do not hide your API definitions, bring them out of the shadow of your API documentation and give me a link I can click on--one click access to a machine-readable definition of the value your API delivers.</p>
<p>I'm sure my regular readers are getting sick of hearing about this, but the reality of my readers is that they are a diverse, and busy group of folks and will most likely not read every post on this important subject. If you have read a previous post on this subject from me, and are reading this latest one, and still do not have API definitions&nbsp;or prominent links--then shame on you for not making your API more accessible and usable...because isn't that what this is all about?</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/26/my-api-definitions-are-incomplete-but-you-do-not-want-to-contribute/">I wrote a post about the emails I get from folks telling me the API definitions contained within my API stack research</a>, something that has helped me better see why it is I do API definitions. I go through APIs and craft OpenAPI Specs for them because it helps me understand the value each company offers, while also helping me discover interesting APIs&nbsp;and the healthy practices behind them.</p>
<p>The reason <a href="http://theapistack.com/">I create API definitions and organize them into collections is all about discovery</a>. While some of the APIs I will be putting to use, most of them just help me&nbsp;better understand the world of APIs&nbsp;and the value and the intent behind the companies who are doing the most interesting things in the space.</p>
<p>I would love it if all <a href="http://theapistack.com/certifying/">my API definitions were 100% certified</a>, and included complete information about the request, response, and security models, but just having the surface area defined makes me happy. My intention is to try and provide as complete of a definition as possible, but the primary stop along the API lifecycle I'm looking to serve is <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">discovery</a>, with other ones like <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">mocking</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDKs</a>, and others following after that.</p>
<p>Maybe if we can all better understand the different reasons behind why&nbsp;we all craft and maintain API definitions we can better leverage Github to help make more of them complete. For now, I'll keep working on my definitions, and if you want to contribute head over to <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">the Github repo for my work</a>, and share any of your own definitions, or <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/issues">submit an issue</a> about which APIs you'd like to see included.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I enjoy profiling APIs is that they give an honest view of what a company does, absent of all the marketing fluff, and the promises that I see from each wave of startups. If designed right, APIs can provide a very functional, distilled down representation of data, content, and algorithmic resources of any company. Some APIs can be very fluffy and verbose, but the good ones are simple, concise, and straight to the point.</p>
<p>As I'm <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/organizations/">profiling the APIs for the companies included in my API monitoring research</a>, what&nbsp;API Science, Apica, API Metrics, BMC Software, DataDog, New Relic, and Runscope offer quickly become pretty clear. A simple list of valuable resources you can put to use when monitoring your APIs. Crafting an OpenAPI Spec allows me to define each of these companies APIs, and easily articulate what it is that they do--minus all the bullshit that often comes with the businesses side of all of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like the detail I include for each company in an APIs.json&nbsp;file provides a nice view of the intent behind an API, while the details I put into the OpenAPI Spec provide insight into whether or not a company actually has any value behind this intent. It can be frustrating to wade through the amount of information some providers feel they need to publish as API documentation, but it all becomes worth it once I have the distilled down OpenAPI Spec, giving an honest view of what each company does.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>I'm looking through a new API definition focused service provider called <a href="http://schemahub.io/">SchemaHub</a> today, and I found their approach to using Github as a base of operations was interesting and provided a nice blueprint for other API server providers to follow. I'm continually amazed at the myriad of ways that Github can be put to use in the world of APIs, which is one of the things I love about it.</p>
<p>As a base for SchemaHub, <a href="https://github.com/schemahub">they created a Github Org</a>, and made their <a href="https://github.com/schemahub/schemahub.github.io">first repository the website for the service</a>, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. In my opinion, this is how all API services should begin, as a repo, under an organization on Github--leveraging the social coding platform as a base for their operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/schemahub/schemahub.github.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/schemahub_github.png" alt="" width="100%" align=" alt=" /></a></p>
<p>SchemaHub is taking advantage of Github for hosting their API definition focused project--free, version controlled, static website hosting for schemahub.io.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_09_28_at_7.34.36_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" align=" alt=" /></p>
<p>As I was looking through their site, learning about what they are doing I noticed a subscription button at the bottom of the page, asking me to subscribe, and they'll notify me when things are ready.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/schemahub_subscribe.png" alt="" width="75%" align=" alt=" /></p>
<p>Once I clicked on the button, I was taken for a Github OAuth dance, which now makes SchemaHub not just a Github repo for the site, it is an actual Github Application that I've authenticated with using my Github account. They only have access to my profile and email, but is the types of provider to developer connection I like to see in the API world.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/authorize_schemahub.png" alt="" width="100%" align=" alt=" /></p>
<p>Once I authorize and connect I am taken to a thank you page back on their website, letting me know I will be contacted shortly with any updates about the service. Oh, and I'm offered a Twitter account as well, allowing me to stay in tune with what they are up to--providing a pretty complete picture for how new API services can operate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/schemahub_thanks.png" alt="" width="65%" align=" alt=" /></p>
<p>SchemaHub's approach reflects <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/27/github-needs-client-oauth-proxy-for-more-complete-clientside-apps-on-pages/">what I'm talking about when I say that Github should offer an Oauth service</a>, something that would enable applications running on Github to establish a Github app as part of their organization and website. I like this model because it enables connections like Schema has established to occur, maximizing the social powers of the Github platform.</p>
<p>SchemaHub wins for making a great first impression on me with their API service. Github Org, simple static Github Pages hosted website, connectivity with my Github profile, and a Twitter account to follow. Now I know who they are, I'm connected, and when they are ready with their API service, they have multiple channels to update me on. My only critique is that I would also like to have a blog with Atom feed, so I can hear stories about what they are trying to accomplish, but that is something that can come later. For now, they are off to a pretty good start.</p>

<p>I'm investing some time learning about the <a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/">USGS Water Services</a>. They have some pretty interesting APIs, providing access to a wealth of data about water table levels, river flows, and other key points across all USGS sites. While their developer area has a wealth of information available, it is also pretty verbose and tough to absorb.</p>
<p>I wanted to help make the information more accessible, filterable, and remixable by turning it into an OpenAPI Spec. It is A LOT OF WORK to craft a complete OpenAPI Spec for a robust API like the six that are available from the USGS. One way I help alleviate this work is to scrape API documentation. As I was preparing to do this I noticed they also have testing tools for 5 out of the 6 APIs, which are just HTML forms containing a definition of the surface area for each API.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Test-Tool.html">Instantaneous Values (IV) Web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Test-Tool.html">Site Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/DV-Test-Tool.html">Daily Values (DV) Web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/GW-Levels-Test-Tool.html">Groundwater Levels Web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Statistics-Service-Test-Tool.html">Statistics Web Service</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The HTML forms provide me with a slightly more structured definition of each API so I will start here. Once I've ingested these, I will write a scrape script for the HTML API documentation, and link the two up. Once I'm done with this I will be able to generate an OpenAPI Spec that is halfway complete (with just the surface area). Once I have this I can load up in my Postman client, turn on Charles Proxy and my internal API monitoring system will fill in the remaining definitions for the Open API Spec--now I have the request and response model, in a machine readable format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I write the code to tackle this, I'm thinking about what a great approach HTML forms are to helping both technical, and semi-technical HTML craftspeople define the surface area of an API. Then I think about my friend Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) and <a href="http://alps.io/">his work on ALPS</a>, and I smile, and I'm reminded of how much work we have ahead of us when it comes to both <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">web literacy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alps-io/profiles">establishing more meaningful, reusable design patterns across the API space</a>(that repo should be full).</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> Is there a better tool out there for turning HTML Forms into OpenAPI Spec or at least JSON or YAML?<br /></em><em><strong>P.S.S.</strong> If you wanna create an API that I can pass any web page with a form in it, and get back an OpenAPI Spec, you are a good person.</em></p>

<p>As the number of available <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> out there grows, I am increasingly coming across variations of APIs that I already have included in my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>. It can be tedious to try and sync these with existing copies, so I wanted to take a look and see if there was anything already available out there, that would help provide a diff for either OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or API Blueprint.</p>
<p>The most common one I found referenced was <a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics/swagger-diff">a Ruby one for OpenAPI Spe</a>c from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics">Civis Analytics</a>. Next, I found a pretty <a href="https://zallek.github.io/swagger-diff/">interesting web tool</a>, which provides its <a href="https://github.com/zallek/swagger-diff/">Node.js source code on Github</a>, including a CLI edition. After these two solutions, I only found <a href="https://github.com/myexpr/raml-diff">one more for RAML</a>, but couldn't find anything for API Blueprint.</p>
<p>I wanted to think beyond just the common API definition formats&nbsp;and look for diff tools that would work just for JSON. I found <a href="https://github.com/andreyvit/json-diff">Diff</a> which was pretty interesting, as well as <a href="https://github.com/janmonschke/diffsync">DiffSync</a> which provided a real-time&nbsp;diff for JSON. I haven't tried any of them out, I am just trying to compile a list of what is out there&nbsp;before I dive into what their capabilities are.</p>
<p>I have a master database of API definitions where I can just import API definitions that I find, and it will add any new paths, parameters, and schemas it comes across. I would much rather have the ability to just run each version through a diff tool, and be able to select which elements I want to have merged. For now, I will just implement a custom layer to my API monitoring system, but I would like to see API diff move forward similar to we saw the conversation evolve with the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>.</p>

<p>I get brought into a lot of API discussions with IT departments from companies, institutions, and government agencies, which are often coordinated by business groups who are interested in better meeting their goals using APIs. This is often an immediately charged conversation, with IT coming to their table with a whole array of baggage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In about 75% of the situations, IT, and developer representatives are nice, or rather they are tight-lipped, relying on a myriad of smoke &amp; mirrors to defend their dark arts. Let me stop for a moment, and put out there that I was IT director from 1998 through 2010. I'm not saying IT are bad people, but there are a wide variety of ways we slow, obfuscate, and distort the conversation to be in our favor -- takes one to know one. I wouldn't say that I was 100% honest in my approach to being an IT leader, but I tried my hardest to keep things as transparent as I possibly could.</p>
<p>Anyways, in a couple of the &nbsp;IT discussions I've had lately, there was an OpenAPI Spec available to define the resources that were on the table, and in a handful of other conversation there were not. Keep in mind that most of these scenarios are with a more traditional version of IT, not with startup technology groups (a whole different beast). As I step back, I am taking notice of the harmonizing effect that an API definition can have, in keeping conversations focused, productive, and moving forward toward a common goal.</p>
<p>In the conversations without an OpenAPI Spec, back-end systems and legacy processes dominated the discussion, even though we are all on a conference call to discuss an external, partner, and public facing API. In the discussions where an OpenAPI Spec was present, we focused on exactly which resources were needed (nothing more), and the details (params, responses, etc) that were needed by all consumers--essentially providing us with a scaffolding for the discussion, that kept things moving forward, and not bogged down in legacy sludge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backend focused discussions&nbsp;always seemed to get slowed down by what was, and what is. The API definition focused conversations seemed to focus on what was needed, using a common language that everyone at the table understood. The presence of an OpenAPI Spec seemed to cut through the smoke &amp; mirrors, which I think often alienates many of the business users. I find having three versions of an OpenAPI Spec and APIs.json file present: 1) simple outline 2) YAML and 3) JSON, was also something that significantly improved discussions, keeping conversations focused while also making them as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p>I think people will always bring their baggage to these discussions, but I'm liking the harmonization effects API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, Postman, and APIs.json are having in&nbsp;these conversations. I'm hopeful that these API definitions can continue providing bridges between business and IT groups, helping close a canyon that has existed for decades.</p>

<p>I am doing way more work on the creation of machine-readable OpenAPI Specs for APIs, indexed using machine-readable APIs.json&nbsp;files than I am the actual creation of APIs lately. About <a href="http://theapistack.com/">half of the API definitions I create are for existing APIs</a>, with <a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">the rest of them describing APIs that should exist</a>. With the existing APIs, in some cases, I am creating client-side code, but mostly just focusing on a well crafted API definition. When it comes to the new API designs, I am focusing on a complete API definition, but also crafting both server-side, as well as client-side code around the definition--when needed.</p>
<p>Even when I do craft server or client code for an API definition, the value of the code is significantly lower than the definition(s). In my mind the code is disposable. I want to be able to throw it away, and start over with anything I am building, at any point. While I have made significant ideological investments into using Linux for my OS, AWS for my compute and storage hosting, MySQL for my database, and PHP + Slim for my API deployment framework, the code that operates within this framework has to be transient. Some code might end up having a long, long life, but if a piece of code isn't generating value, and in the way, I want to either get rid of it or rewrite it to better meet the requirements.</p>
<p>When it comes to delivering technology in my world, my investments are increasingly in the API definitions, underlying data schemas, and the data and content that is actually stored and transmitted within. The PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is valuable, but a second class citizen to the JSON, and YAML representations of my APIs, schemas, and the valuable data and content stored. For me personally, having made significant investments in a variety of tech solutions historically, this provides me with the flexibility I need to live in the current online climate. This is something that only has been coming into focus in the last year, so I assume it will also continue to evolve in focus over the next couple of years, but I am already seeing significant returns from my investing in definitions over the code when it comes to my API strategy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman</a>, have been gaining in popularity over the last couple of years, mostly because of the their ability to deploy interactive documentation like Swagger UI. However, the API providers who have been using them the longest, have also realized these machine readable definitions can be applied effectively at almost every step along <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/08/my-api-life-cycle-research-from-design-to-deprecation/">a modern API life cycle, from design to deprecation</a>.</p>
<p>I'm always encouraging companies, who are selling software services to the API space (aka API service providers), to make sure and have APIs for their entire stack, as well as speak in as many of the leading API definition formats as you possibly can. To help in this effort, I try to regularly showcase the API service providers who are doing it right--this round, its the folks over at <span><a href="http://apimetrics.io">APImetrics</a></span>.</p>
<p>The screen that comes up, when you go to add new API calls to the monitoring service is exactly what I am talking about, allowing me to get up and running using the API definition format of my choosing.</p>
<p><a href="http://apimetrics.io"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Fullscreen_4_8_16__1_09_PM.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I am given the option to manually add an API, or do a bulk import of the APIs I wish to monitor using the service. I'm given the option of importing WSDL, OpenAPI Spec, RAML, Blueprint, and Postman, which reflects the leading API definition formats, any API service provider should be speaking by default. If you need help enabling this in your services, I recommend talking to the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> folks about using their <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> are quickly becoming the central contract that gets passed around among technical folks, and increasingly with business units as well. No matter where you exist on the API life cycle, between API design, all the way to deprecation, your customers should be able to onboard, and offboard using all of the modern API definition formats--enabling your users get up and running in seconds, rather than minutes, hours, or even not at all.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-scraping.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was looking to create an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> plus <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec(s)</a> for the <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/">WordPress.org API</a>, and the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html">Instructure Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) API</a>. I am pulling together a toolkit to support a workshop at Davidson College in North Carolina this month, and I&nbsp;<a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">wanted a handful of APIs that would be relevant to students, and faculty on campus</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my experience, when it comes to documenting large APIs using OpenAPI Spec, you don't want to be hand rolling things, making auto generation essential. There are two options for accomplishing this, 1) I can use a proxy like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/05/automated-mapping-of-the-api-universe-with-charles-proxy-dropbox-openapi-spec-and-some-custom-apis/">Charles</a> or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/16/automagically-defining-your-api-infrastructure-as-you-work-using-stoplightio/">Stoplight.io</a>, or 2) I can write a script to scrape the publicly available HTML documentation for each API. While I do enjoy playing with mapping out APIs in Stoplight.io, allowing it do the heavy lifting of crafting each API definition, sometimes there is more relevant meta data for the API available in the API documentation.</p>
<p>The OpenAPI Spec, plus APIs.json files for both the <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/data/wordpress/apis.json">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam//data/instructure-canvas/apis.json">Instructure Canvas</a> APIs took me about an hour a each, to write the script, and round off the OpenAPI Spec, making sure it was as complete as possible. Through scraping, I get description for endpoints, parameters, and sometimes I also get other detail including sample responses, enum, and response codes.</p>
<p>One downside of obtaining an API definition by scraping, is that I only get the surface area of an API, not the responses, and underlying data model. Sometimes this is included in documentation, but I do not always harvest this--waiting until I can get a often more correct schema, when I map out using a proxy or via HAR file. This is OK. I find the trade-off worth it. I'd rather have the more human-centered descriptions, and names of each endpoints, than the response definitions--that will come with time, and more usage of the actual APIs.</p>
<p>In the end, it really depends to the size of an API, and the quality of the API documentation. If it is a big API, and the documentation is well crafted, it is preferable to scrape and auto generate the definition. Once I have this, I can load it into Postman or Stoplight.io, start making API calls, and use either Stoplight's proxy, or my own solution that uses Charles Proxy, to provide the remaining schema of the responses, as well as the resulting HTTP status code(s).</p>
<p>I think the human touch on all APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and API Blueprint files will prove to be essential in streamlining interactions at every stop along the API life cycle. If you can't easily understand what an API does, and what the moving parts are, the rest won't matter, so having simple, well written titles, and descriptions for APIs that are described in each machine readable definition is well worth any extra work. Even with auto generation via scraping, or Stoplight.io, I find I still have have to give each API definitions a little extra love to make sure they are as polished as possible.</p>
<p>I'm thinking I will start keeping a journal of the work goes into crafting each API's definition(s). It might be something I can use down the road to further streamline the creation, and maintenance of my API definitions, and the API services I develop to support all of this.</p>
<p>Here is the APIs.json for the Wordpress.org API by the way:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/03e0f6cce5ebddd46028.js"></script>
<p>Here is the APIs.json for the Instructure Canvas API as well:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/ede7a42b29b4214eefb2.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/indie-edtech-data-jam/">You can see these, and some other API definitions for my workshop over at the Github repo for the project</a>. I created a new Liquid template, that allows me to display APIs.json and OpenAPI Specs within the Jekyll site for this project. Something that I will be using to better deliver API driven content, visualizations, and other resources that help us learn about, and put APIs to work.</p>

        <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cl74hjb3vikaorq1o506seejl7s">I held a hangout with API Evangelist this morning</a>, with Steve Willmot (<a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/njyx"><span>@</span>njyx</a>)<span> of </span><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/3scale"><span>@</span>3scale</a><span>, &amp; Jakub Nesetril (</span><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril"><span>@</span>jakubnesetril</a>)<span> of </span><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/apiaryio"><span>@</span>apiaryio</a><span>&nbsp;today, where we discussed API definitions. Both Steve and Jakub are CEOs of leading tech companies, who are taking frontline positions when it comes to the whole API definition conversation.</span></p>
<p>My role in this hangout, was just bringing together these two API leaders, to discuss the most important topic facing us in the world of APIs. API definitions are touching on every aspect of the API life cycle, and as Steve and Jakub discuss, playing a central role in their businesses, and their customer's businesses. We published the hour and half conversation on Youtube, so you can join in, even if you couldn't make the hangout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrGPHBQ4dGo" width="560" height="315" align="center"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus on API definitions being the contract, was the most important part of today's hangout for me. This wasn't a conversation about just Swagger, or API Blueprint, it was a discussion about the role API definitions play in the API life cycle, from the latest wave of API description formats like Swagger and Blueprint, to API discovery formats like APIs.json, and even media types, and schemas. These are the contracts we are using to communicate our ideas, generate code, setup tests, drive documentation, and make the API economy go roudn.</p>
<p>This hangout was scheduled to be an hour, but there was so much to cover, we took it an extra 30 minutes. The conversation left me feeling like I need to do this more often, expanding on the API definition discussion, but also push into other important areas like API deployment, virtualization, discovery, monitoring, and the other almost 40 areas of the API lifecycle I track on. We'll see how much time i have to do these, but more importantly my ability to bring smart people like Steve and Jakub together--something I hope I can make it work.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jakub and Steve for participating today!</p>

<p>Join me, Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a>, and Jakub Nesetril(<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>) of <a href="http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0">Apiary</a>, for a hangout on API definitions this week. I wanted to explore&nbsp; doing more hangouts under the APIStrat, as well as API Evangelist brand(s)--for this one I wanted to bring together some experts to talk about the fast moving world of API definitions, as a <a href="http://hangoutwith.apievangelist.com/">Hangout with API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://hangouts.apistrat.com/">This Wednesday, January 27th, at 11:00 AM PST, the three of us will jump on a Google Hangout</a>, and you are welcome to join in the conversation. We will be doing the gathering as a Hangout on Air, so that you can ask questions if you want, joining in the live conversation, or you can wait until after we are done, I will make sure and publish the video to Youtube.</p>

<p>Its a pretty important time for API definitions with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">the Swagger specification reborn as the OpenAPISpec</a>, and Apiary, the creator of API Blueprint and MSON, <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2016/01/18/We-ve-got-Swagger/">also adopting OpenAPI Spec this last week, allowing you to design and mock your API in both formats</a>. 3Scale was an earlier adopter of Swagger, and <a href="http://www.3scale.net/tag/swagger/">has taken a leadership position in shepherding it to into the Linux Foundation, and is a member of the governance working group</a>.</p>
<p>I figured that it is a pretty good time to check-in with Steve and Jakub, on the current state of API definitions, and how they see them impacting their own platforms, as well as the overall API space.
